<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p><span class="smc">At</span> the present time,
when the Sabbath controversy is engaging so much of
the public attention, and when Sabbath Conventions and Sabbath Unions
are being chronicled almost monthly, I consider it unnecessary to offer
any apology for the introduction of the following work to the public
notice. My reader need not fear a repetition or recapitulation of the
arguments generally employed in favour of the sabbatical institution, as
it refers either to the first or the last day of the week; neither will
his attention be wearied by prolix and verbose details. It has been my
aim to collect, collate, and condense facts, as much as appeared
consistent with perspicuity. I have not taken any new stand with regard
to the Sabbath question. The Seventh-day Baptists have, from the first,
contended that the Sabbath was changed, not by Christ or his Apostles,
but by ecclesiastical synods and councils. This could only be proved
convincingly by reference to the practice of those churches who were
removed by distance or otherwise beyond the pale of such authority. That
the Armenian, East Indian, and Abyssinian Episcopacies were so removed,
and that they absolutely refused to succumb to the authority of the
Latin or Greek prelates, sustaining in consequence the most cruel and
desolating wars, is an undeniable historical fact; no less so the truth
that during all this time they have been living witnesses against
Anti-Christ, as the observers of the ancient Sabbath, which practice
they learned from the Apostles, or their immediate successors.</p>

<p>With respect to the History of the Seventh-day Baptist denomination, I
am not unaware of the imperfections that may be detected in it. But I
must excuse my own defects by a just complaint of the blindness and
insufficiency of my guides; and may also observe that, with reference to
nearly every portion of the work, I have been the pioneer in the field
of research.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS.</h2>

</div>

<p><span class="smc">The</span> word Sabbatarian, whether bestowed by their enemies
as a term of opprobrium upon those who observed the
seventh day of the week as the Sabbath, or whether
assumed by themselves, is, nevertheless, peculiarly appropriate,
and very distinguishing of this particular tenet in
their system of religious faith. Neither do we hesitate to
employ it in a very extensive sense, as comprehending all
those religious communities, whatever may be their names,
modes of worship, or forms of ecclesiastical discipline, who
refrain from secular employments upon the last day of the
week, and observe the same as holy time. There cannot,
therefore, be any impropriety in considering the Abyssinian
and Armenian Churches as sabbatarian organizations,
although the former has become greatly corrupted
in worship and doctrine, and exhibits few traces of the
purity and simplicity of primitive Christianity.</p>

<p>We claim for sabbatarian institutions a very high antiquity,
and a multitude of the most illustrious exemplars;
from that grand sabbath proclaimed over the new-born
world by the Eternal Father, and observed by angelic and
seraphic intelligences, to its second ordainment amid the
smoke and thunders of Sinai, and its subsequent observance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">{14}</a></span>
by kings, priests, sages, and witnesses for the truth
through so many ages, to Him, the Great High Priest of
the Covenant, who sanctified the law and made it honourable.
It is incontestable that our adorable Lord and his
Apostles observed the seventh day of the week, and it was
not until a long time subsequent to the close of their
earthly pilgrimages that the reverence due to this holy
time was transferred, in any Christian community, to the
Dominical day.</p>

<p>The first Christian church established in the world was
founded at Jerusalem under the immediate superintendence
of the Apostles. This church, which was the model of all
those that were founded in the first century, was undoubtedly
sabbatarian. In the second and third centuries, according
to the testimony of Mosheim, it was very generally
observed. During the fourth and in the commencement
of the fifth centuries, it was almost universally solemnized,
if the veracity of Socrates, the ecclesiastical historian, may
be depended upon.</p>

<p>We have every reason to believe, however, that from
the first, or, indeed, at a very early period, a superstitious
veneration was paid in some places to the first day of the
week. It is certain that, before the close of the first century,
the original purity and simplicity of Christianity had
become greatly defaced and deplorably corrupted by the
introduction into its doctrines of the monstrous tenets of a
preposterous philosophy, and into its ceremonies of a multitude
of heathen rites. Identical with this was the appointment
of various festivals to be observed on particular
days. These days were those on which the martyrs had
laid down their lives for the truth, the day on which the
Saviour had been crucified, and that also on which he rose
from the dead. We have no reason to suppose that the
observation of the first day dates back any earlier than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">{15}</a></span>
that of Friday, or those anniversary festivals which were
introduced to commemorate the descent of the Holy Ghost
upon the Apostles, and the feast of Easter. All were the
fruits of as dark, fabulous, and superstitious times, as have
ever been since the resurrection of Christ. It seems to
have been the policy of the rulers of the church at this
period, to assimilate Christianity in its rites and festivals
to the manners of Paganism, and in its doctrines to the
tenets of a corrupt yet seducing philosophy. For such a
course of conduct various reasons may be assigned. In
the first place they were pleasing to the multitude, who
were more delighted with the pageantry and circumstance
of external ceremonies, and the frequency of holidays,
than with the valuable attainments of rational and consistent
piety, or with a sober and steady course of life.</p>

<p>In the second place, we have reason to believe that the
bishops augmented the number of the religious ceremonies
and festivals in the Christian worship, by way of accommodating
it to the prejudices and infirmities of both Jews
and heathens, in order to facilitate their conversion. These
people were accustomed to a round of pompous and magnificent
ceremonies in their religious service; and, as they
deemed these rites an essential part of religion, it was
natural for them to regard with indifference, or even with
contempt, any service whose forms were divested of all
specious and captivating appearances. As their religion
allowed to them a multitude of festivals, the bishops supposed,
and not without reason, that they persisted in their
idolatry on account of the ease, pleasure, and sensual
gratifications thereby enjoyed, consequently the rulers of
the church adopted certain external ceremonies, and appointed
festivities, in order to allure the senses of the vulgar,
and to make them more disposed to embrace Christianity.
The effect of this course of conduct was most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">{16}</a></span>
pernicious. It effaced the beautiful simplicity of Christianity,
and corrupted its natural purity in order to extend
its influence; thus making it lose that practical excellence
for which no popular esteem could ever afford compensation.
It may be allowable, it may even be commendable,
to accommodate ecclesiastical as well as civil institutions,
in certain cases, to the infirmities of mankind, and to
make some concessions, some prudent instances of compliance
to their invincible prejudices, but all these should
be of such a nature as not to derogate from the majesty of
the divine law, or to substitute for the ordinances of God
the observances and institutions of fallible men.</p>

<p>The multiplication of festivals and holidays would naturally
bring the Sabbath into neglect, but what contributed
more than anything else to destroy its influence over the
minds of men, was the almost universal abhorrence in
which the Jews were held. We are informed that multitudes
of Christians, in the time of Adrian, abandoned all
the rites and institutions of their religion that bore any
resemblance to the Jewish ritual, for fear of being confounded
with that people, who had become obnoxious to
the prince, and were suffering the extremity of his vengeance.
"Let us have nothing in common with that
odious brood, the Jews," says Constantine, when issuing
his edict for the observation of the Dominical day. Subsequently,
the sabbath was condemned for the same reasons
by synods and councils; popes and kings rose up in
judgment against it. Perhaps they feared also that its
observation would remind the people of that sacred volume,
which the prelates chose, for their own convenience,
to keep from the world, and in which their condemnation,
as followers of the most detestable vices, would be so
strongly marked. Moreover they were determined, in the
plenitude of their arrogance, to give laws in both a temporal
and spiritual sense; to govern the consciences as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">{17}</a></span>
they ruled the actions of mankind. Nor was this all,
some of these prelates actually aspired to stand, at least
in the eyes of the multitude, in the place of God,—to
divert the adoration, which should be paid to him, to
themselves, or to the relics they had blessed, and the
saints they had canonized. Would not the observation of
the sabbath have tended to recall the minds of men to the
Maker of all things, as the only true and proper object for
religious adoration; to the fact that he alone was the
moral governor of the universe; his laws the standard of
perfection; himself of infallibility? History presents
numerous examples of kings and tyrants, who have assumed
the attributes of Deity, and demanded the homage
of mankind; but, perhaps, a more impious imitation of his
power, a more blasphemous assumption of his prerogatives,
were never exhibited than in the conduct of these hierarchs.
Did God appoint one mediator between himself and man,—behold
the saints they canonized; did he bestow the
Scriptures as his revealed will upon the world,—behold the
canons of the church in which their authority is superseded;
and did he institute and command the observation
of the seventh day as a day of rest,—they substitute an
other in its place. The Sabbath is reprobated as a Jewish
institution: it is a wonder that we hear nothing of a Jewish
religion, as Christianity certainly originated with that
people; of a Jewish Saviour, since the Redeemer was of
the offspring of David; and of Jewish apostles, as not one
of the twelve were of the Gentile race. We must go to
the Jews for the Bible, in which is contained the knowledge
of God, and the hope of the world; we must go to
the Jews for examples of godliness in the long, dark ages
before the Christian era; why not go to them for a sabbath
likewise? The spiritual pride that opposes such a
measure will not stand in the great and burning day.

 <small>SABBATARIAN CHURCHES IN ASIA AND AFRICA.</small></h2>

 <h3 class="nobreak">SECTION I.<br />
 <small>HISTORY OF THE ARMENIAN CHURCH.</small></h3>

</div>

<p><span class="smc">The</span> religious and political history of Armenia has, from
the earliest ages, been pregnant with great events; but,
obedient to necessity; I condense within a few pages what
might fill as many volumes, and content myself with giving
an outline of the subject that some future historian may
amplify and adorn. In countries where there exists a
union between the church and the state, and the prelatic
dignity is supported by royal authority, the revolutions of
the former are intimately connected with the convulsions
of the latter,—the temporal with the spiritual affairs. But
the archiepiscopal see of Armenia appears to have preserved
its ancient form of discipline and doctrine in the
most remarkable manner, notwithstanding the changes of
the royal and ducal dynasties in the state, and its alternate
subjection to Saracenic and Persian dominion.</p>

<p>The propagation of the gospel throughout Armenia is
ascribed by ancient historians to St. Bartholomew, who is
said to be identical with  Nathaniel,—that Israelite indeed.
In Albanopolis, a city of this country, we are informed
that the apostle suffered martyrdom; but his blood only
watered the seed of divine truth, and caused a more glorious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">{19}</a></span>
harvest of proselytes from the Zendavesta to the gospel,—from
the adoration of the host of heaven to the spiritual
worship of their Maker, "the King immortal, eternal, and
invisible."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the penal edicts of the sovereign, and
the opposition of the Magian priesthood, Christianity
flourished like a tree planted by the rivers of water, and
the rising generations of Armenia reposed under its salutary
shade. Few religious sects have been extirpated by
persecution. Religion shines brightest in the night of
adversity; it is quenched and extinguished in the sunshine
of courts. Zeal and intrepidity are always stimulated by
the presence of an enemy. The Christians of Armenia
received the crown of martyrdom, rejoicing that they were
accounted worthy to suffer for their attachment to the
cross. At last, however, the eloquence of a priest, named
Gregory, succeeded in converting the monarch and his
principal nobility, who received the rite of baptism, and
entered into the communion of the church. In consequence
of this, Leontius, bishop of Cappadocia, consecrated Gregory
bishop of the Armenians, and their church became
annexed to the episcopal jurisdiction of the Antiochan
prelate.</p>

<p>This circumstance, so fortunate in a temporal sense,
proved highly destructive to its spiritual repose. No
longer assaulted, it became the parent of schism; and one
Eustathius, an obscure priest, has given his name to history,
by the success that attended his efforts to create an
excitement and faction in the church. The convention of
a Council at Gangra might condemn and excommunicate,
but could not suppress this faction, which poured forth
legions of missionaries, and for a long time disturbed the
repose of the Eastern prelates. The doctrines of Eustathius
were neither heretical, nor his conduct in introducing them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">{20}</a></span>
truly reprehensible, although from their nature highly
offensive to the spiritual dignitaries, who, to judge from
their habits of life, found more solace in wine and female
intercourse than in religious exercises, and who were more
solicitous to acquire wealth and preferments to enrich their
physical heirs, than solicitous about the welfare of their
spiritual progeny. Producing the example and judgment
of Paul, Eustathius boldly condemned the marriages of the
priests, under any circumstances, as productive of evil;
but denounced second and third marriages as abominable,
and worthy of excommunication. The use of wine,—in
short, all sensual delights,—he prohibited, as equally
reprehensible in those who were set as exemplars and
rulers of the flock of Christ. Eustathius was succeeded by
Erius, a priest, and semi-Arian, who not only protested
against the multiplied marriages of the priests, but declared
that the bishops were not distinguished from the presbyters
by any divine right, and that, according to the Holy Scriptures,
their authority and offices were identical. This
tenet, of which the immediate consequences would have
been to reduce within certain limits the power of the prelates,
raised a storm of opposition from that quarter,
although it was highly agreeable to many good Christians,
to whom their tyranny and arrogance had become insupportable.
Erius also condemned fasts, stated feasts,
prayers for the dead, and the celebration of Easter; but
he urged a purer morality and a stricter observance of the
Sabbath. He had many followers, whose numbers were
greatly augmented by one Paul of Samosota, from whom
they were called Paulicians. Notwithstanding the opposition
of the prelates, who invoked the secular arm to prevent
the defection of their spiritual subjects, the tenets of
this sect struck deep root in Armenia and many of the
eastern provinces, and finally the great body of Christians
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">{21}</a></span>
in the former country, withdrew from the Episcopal communion,
and publicly espoused the sentiments of the Paulicians.
These were accused of breaking loose from the
brotherhood of the Christian world, and they were denounced
by the bishops as the most odious of mankind.
Whatever might have been the denunciations of their adversaries,
posterity, after a candid examination of their
tenets, must concede that they were principally distinguished
for an adherence to the strict letter of the sacred text, and
for the primitive simplicity of their forms of worship.
Their ecclesiastical institutions exhibited the most liberal
principle of reason. The austerity of the cloister was
relaxed, and gradually forgotten. The standard of piety
was changed from absurd penances to purity of life and
morals. Houses of charity were endowed for the support
and education of orphans and foundlings, and the religious
teachers were obliged to depend for temporal support upon
the voluntary subscriptions of their brethren and the labour
of their own hands. To these churches, famous throughout
the East no less for the purity of their worship than
their exemption from ecclesiastical tyranny, myriads of
fugitives resorted from all the provinces of the Eastern
empire, and the narrow bigotry of the emperors was
punished by the emigration of their most useful subjects,
who transported into a foreign realm the arts of both peace
and war. Among the mountains of Armenia, and beyond
the precincts of the Roman power, they seemed to have
found a new world, where they might breathe the air of
religious freedom. The emperors, ignorant of the rights
of conscience, and incapable of pity or esteem for the
heretics who durst dispute the infallibility of holy councils,
and refused to acquiesce in their imperial decisions, vainly
sought, by various methods, to excite against them the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">{22}</a></span>
indignation of their sovereign and the vengeance of persecution.</p>

<p>During this time the Paulicians had increased in a wonderful
manner. The desire of gaining souls for God, and
subjects for the church, has, in all ages, fired the zeal and
animated the activity of the Christian priesthood. It must
not be supposed that the Paulicians were less arduous in
the prosecution of their spiritual enterprises. Assuming
the character of travelling merchants, or in the habits of
pilgrims, a character to this day sacred throughout the
East, they joined the Indian caravans, or pursued without
fear the footsteps of the roving Tartar. The hordes encamped
on the verdant banks of the Selinga, or in the
valleys of the Imaus, heard, with feelings of mysterious
reverence, the story of the incarnation; and illiterate
shepherds and sanguinary warriors forsook their flocks
and deserted their camps to listen to the simple eloquence
of an Armenian pilgrim. Perhaps the exposition of a
metaphysical creed was no more comprehensible to the one
than were lessons of humanity and repose to the other;
but both were susceptible of the baser passions of hope and
fear, and both could understand the effect that their rejection
or adoption of the gospel would exercise, according
to the popular belief, upon their destiny in a future world.
The mysterious rites of Christianity were administered to
multitudes, among whom a great Khan and his warriors
were said to be included.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_1" id="Ref_1" href="#Foot_1">[1]</a></span> In other regions the Paulicians
were no less successful. Unwonted crowds resorted to the
banks of Abana and Pharpar, whose limpid waters seemed
particularly appropriate for the administration of the baptismal
rite. The bishops of Syria, Pontus, and Cappadocia,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">{23}</a></span>
complained of the defection of their spiritual flocks.
Their murmurs, a principle of policy, above all an implacable
hatred against everything bearing the semblance of
freedom, induced the Grecian emperors to commence, and
continue for nearly two centuries, the most terrible persecutions
against the Paulicians. During these frightful
convulsions, Armenia was ravaged from border to border
with fire and sword; its monarchy—then held by a younger
branch of the family of the Parthian kings—extinguished;
its cities demolished, and its inhabitants either massacred
by the hands of their enemies, driven into exile, or sold
into servitude. Great numbers fled for safety and protection
to the Saracens, by whom they were hospitably entertained,
and who permitted them to build a city for their
residence, which was called Tibrica. This afforded them
an opportunity for returning, with interest, the miseries
that they had suffered at the hands of the Greeks; for,
entering into a league with the Saracens, and choosing for
their leader a chief named Carbeas, they prosecuted
against the Greeks a war which continued during the century,
and in which the slaughter on both sides was prodigious.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_2" id="Ref_2" href="#Foot_2">[2]</a></span>
During these convulsions several companies of
the Paulicians passed into Bulgaria, Thrace, and the neighbouring
provinces, where their opinions became the source
of new dissensions. After the Council of Basil had commenced
its deliberations, these sectaries removed into Italy,
where they became amalgamated with the Albigenses and
Waldenses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">{24}</a></span>
Armenia, reduced from an independent kingdom to a
ducal sovereignty, maintained a real independence, though
in nominal servitude. The Roman emperors, in the decline
of their greatness, were content with the name of homage
and the shadow of allegiance. A robe of rare texture and
curious workmanship, formed of the hair or wool by which
the mother-of-pearl, a shell-fish of the Mediterranean,
attaches itself to the rock, was their annual imperial gift
that purchased the nominal fealty of the Armenian satraps.
But the Church, notwithstanding this political vassalage,
preserved its independence. The Armenian priests, in consequence
of their ignorance of the Greek tongue, were
unable to assist at the Council of Chalcedon, but the doctrines
of Eutyches, to which they still adhere, were propagated
among them, perhaps, with a slight modification,
by Julian of Halicarnassus. From the earliest ages they
have devoutly hated the error and idolatry of the Greeks.
Like the primitive Christians, they have ever exhibited an
unconquerable repugnance to the use or abuse of images,
which, in the eighth and ninth centuries, spread like a
leprosy through nearly all Christendom, and supplanted
all traces of genuine piety in the visible church by the
grossest superstition. They are decidedly adverse to the
adoration of relics, the worship of the Virgin, or the observation
of the feasts and festivals of the Church. They
regarded the Greeks as idolaters;—the Greeks accused
them of Judaism, heresy, and atheism, and to these accusations,
with the feelings they engendered, may be ascribed
the unrelenting animosity and persecution that they waged
against each other, and which terminated only when the
Grecian empire ceased to exist.</p>

<p>Armenia has, in all ages, been the theatre of hostile
operations. Times without number her cities have been
plundered, her harvests consumed, and her flocks slaughtered,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">{25}</a></span>
to gratify the cupidity or to satiate the hunger of
armies, who, in the character of allies, were marching
through her territories. The empire of the East has, in
many instances, been contested upon her fields; and,
though generally in servitude, seldom has she been permitted
to enjoy the tranquillity of that state. Yet subsequent
to the firm establishment of the Saracen dominion
in Asia, they enjoyed a long period of prosperity and
repose. When the Saracenic empire became supplanted
by that of the Tartars, the consequences to the Eastern
Christians were most deplorable.</p>

<p>These ruthless conquerors destroyed, wherever they went,
the fair fruits that had arisen from the labours of the missionaries,
extirpated the religion of Jesus from several
cities and provinces where it had flourished, and substituted
the Mohammedan superstition in its place. The Armenian
churches, in particular, experienced the most deplorable
evils from the ruthless and vindictive spirit of Timur
Bec, or Tamerlane, the Tartar chief. This implacable
warrior, having overrun a great part of northern and
western Asia, exerted all his influence and authority to
compel the Christians to apostatize from their faith. To
the stern dictates of unlimited power he united the compulsory
violence of persecution, and treated the disciples
of Christ with the most unrelenting severity; subjecting
such as magnanimously adhered to their religion, to the
most cruel forms of death, or to the horrors of unmitigated
slavery. Under the successors of Timur they were subjected
to many vicissitudes, being alternately protected
and oppressed, according as the caprice of the reigning
sovereign seemed to dictate. Nevertheless, under the rod
of oppression their zeal was intrepid and fervent, nor
could the sunshine of prosperity warm in their hearts an
undue love of the world, and render them careless or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">{26}</a></span>
indifferent to the interests of Christianity. In numberless
instances they preferred the crown of martyrdom to the
turban of Mohammed, and have sacrificed the dearest of
temporal interests,—fame, wealth, and preferments, to a
scrupulous adherence to the Christian profession, and a
strict regard for its duties. Once only within the last
thirteen centuries has Armenia aspired to the rank of an
independent kingdom, and even then her Christian kings,
who arose and fell, in the thirteenth century, on the confines
of Cilicia, were the creatures and vassals of the
Turkish sultans of Iconium. About the commencement of
the seventeenth century their state experienced a considerable
change in consequence of the incursions of Shah
Abbas, the great king of Persia.</p>

<p>This prince, justly apprehensive from the victorious
approach of the Turks, ravaged that part of Armenia
which lay contiguous to his dominions, and ordered the
inhabitants to retire into Persia. It will be perceived that
these devastations were not intended to evince hostility
against the Armenians, but to retard and embarrass the
advance of the Turks. Encouraged by the monarch, the
most opulent of the Armenians removed to Ispahan, where
the Emperor appropriated a beautiful suburb for their residence,
and permitted them to enjoy every civil and religious
privilege, under the jurisdiction of their own bishop
or patriarch. During the administration of this magnanimous
prince these happy exiles partook the sweets of
liberty and abundance, but his death was the signal for the
triumph of their enemies. A storm of persecution succeeded,
in which the constancy of multitudes was shaken;
indeed, so general was the apostacy, that for a time it
appeared probable that this branch of the Armenian Church
would be lost. These apprehensions proved to be groundless.
To the abatement of the rage of their enemies succeeded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">{27}</a></span>
the restoration of their political rights. Their
churches, in Ispahan and other Persian cities, that had
been demolished, were rebuilt, and their schools, which
had been shut, were re-opened. It is said that, at present,
many of the most luxurious seats in Persia are occupied
by opulent Armenians. In Bagdad and Damascus they
vend the magnificent silks of Oriental manufacture, and
preside over the creation of those exquisite fabrics that
are the admiration of the world. In all these cities they
have meeting-houses, with burial-grounds attached, in
which flowers of rare beauty and exquisite odours are
cultivated. In these burial-gardens, were it not for the
presence of monumental marble, one would forget the contiguity
of death and decay. The splendid palms, the
glorious rose-trees, and the living song of birds, are anything
but inspiring of melancholy thoughts.</p>

<p>The Bible was translated at a very early period into the
Armenian language, but, in 1690, the call for the Scriptures
became so great that the manuscript copies were not
sufficient to supply the demand. To remedy this evil, it
was decided by a council of Armenian bishops, assembled
in 1692, to perpetuate and multiply that Holy Book, by
the art of printing, of which they had heard in Europe.
They first applied to France, but the Catholic church objected
to printing and distributing the Bible. It was accomplished,
however, through the agency of some Armenian
merchants, who had settled, for purposes of commerce,
at London, Venice, Amsterdam, and many other European
cities. This Bible agrees in a wonderful manner with the
English version of the Scriptures, to which it is not inferior
in correctness of diction and beauty of typography.
The religion of Armenia has derived few advantages from
the power or learning of its votaries, but with the Bible in
their native tongue, and being permitted to read and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">{28}</a></span>
exercise their private judgment in its interpretation, it is
not so very surprising that their church has remained uncontaminated
by Grecian, Roman, and Mohammedan corruptions.
It must not be supposed that the Roman pontiffs,
ever zealous to enlarge the bounds of their jurisdiction,
were mindless of engaging the Christians of the East
to submit to their supremacy. On the contrary, this was
for a considerable time the chief purpose that excited their
ambitious views, and employed their labours and assiduities.
But these attempts were unavailing, nor could any
union between the churches ever be effected.</p>

<p>The residence of the Armenian patriarch is at Ekmiasin,—three
leagues from Erivan. Forty-seven archbishops,
of whom each may claim the obedience of four or five
suffragans, are consecrated by his hand. Many of these,
however, are only titular prelates, who dignify by their
presence the simplicity of his court. Their performance
of the liturgy is succeeded by their cultivation of the
ground; and, unlike the prelates of Europe, the austerity
of their life and the plainness of their appearance increases
in just proportion to the elevation of their rank. Throughout
the fourscore thousand villages of his spiritual empire,
the patriarch receives the tribute of a small but voluntary
tax from each individual above the age of sixteen years.
But this income is not expended on luxurious living, being
employed to supply the incessant demands of charity and
tribute. The Indian caravan, laden with its precious commodities,
usually halts in the vicinity of Erivan, which,
through the influence of the wealth thus distributed, has
become a splendid and beautiful city, adorned with fountains,
groves, and splendid churches.</p>

<p>Besides the churches in Armenia proper, there are congregations
of the same faith and forms of worship in Barbary,
Egypt, Poland, Greece, and Turkey. They have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">{29}</a></span>
churches also in nearly all the Oriental cities, between
which a continual intercourse and communication is carried
on by the travelling merchants or pedlars of that sect, who
are distributed all over the East. Decidedly intelligent,
and frequently adepts in Oriental literature, they are always
found at the courts of the Eastern princes, where they act
in the capacity of interpreters. Armenian ladies are
generally chosen to fill the station of favourite, or companion,
to the Sultanas.</p>

<p>The Armenian Christians are eminently qualified for the
office of extending the knowledge of the gospel throughout
the East; and the time is not far distant when they will
prove the most efficient body of missionaries in the world.
Indeed, without the name, in a multitude of instances,
they have assumed their character and acted their part.
It is true that they are unacquainted with the European
habit of supporting expensive missions in foreign countries,
but like the Waldenses, they travel as venders of merchandise,
and embrace all opportunities to impart instruction.</p>

<p>They carried the knowledge of the gospel into China,
when that country was inaccessible to Europeans; and
long before the English obtained a footing in India, they
had erected churches in all the principal cities of that
empire, in which the worship of God was maintained upon
every ensuing Sabbath. They are familiar with the Oriental
languages, and acquainted with the habits of the people,
who consequently feel no dread of their foreign character,
but regard them from the first as brothers and friends.
The first version of the Scriptures into the Chinese language
was made by an Armenian, named Joannes Lassar,
whose knowledge of Oriental literature was really surprising,
and who was no less eminent for genuine and enlightened
piety.</p>

<p>Their ecclesiastical establishment in Hindostan is very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">{30}</a></span>
respectable. The bishop visits Calcutta, but he is not
resident there. They have churches in Calcutta, in Madras,
and in Bombay, which contain together about two
thousand communicants. There are also churches in the
interior. Of these they have one at Dacca, another at
Syndbad, and a third at Chinsurah, that are large and
flourishing. In these churches the greatest simplicity prevails,
and everything accords with the apostolic character
of the worshippers. No magnificent altar, blazing
with gold and gems, no gorgeous candelabra, no exquisite
creations of painting or statuary, no imposing ceremonies;
neither genuflexions nor lustrations; neither instrumental
harmonies, nor services performed with pompous parade
and in an unknown tongue. The cross is the only ornament
of their churches, accompanied with the Bible and
the liturgy.</p>

<p>From these prayers and texts are read by the officiating
priest, succeeded by an appropriate discourse, and the
whole closes with singing a psalm much in the style and
manner of an anthem.</p>

<p>Baptism, among the Armenians, is administered by
immersion in rivers, or running streams, if such are convenient;
when otherwise, in a room, called the baptistery,
which is always contiguous to the church. They regard
the sacrament as a memorial of the Saviour's passion,—nothing
more,—and administer it in both kinds to the
laity. They reject the observation of saints' days, or the
festivals of Christ, but declare that God, in his word,
ordained the seventh day as a day of rest, which they
religiously observe.</p>

<p>The Armenians are not ignorant of the nature of experimental
religion. Many individuals among them have
exhibited examples of genuine and enlightened piety, and
have expired in the triumphs of faith. Their moral character,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">{31}</a></span>
as might be supposed, far exceeds that of any
other Eastern people. The women are modest, dignified,
and observant of their conjugal relations; the men are intelligent
and affable. Their general character is that of a
wealthy, industrious, and enterprising people. Their companionship
is courted all over the East.</p>

<p>They occupy posts of honour and profit, they monopolize
commerce, and hold the highest rank as artisans and
manufacturists. Is not the hand of God in this thing?
Are they not designed, at some future period, to work
wonders in the moral renovation of mankind? For that
purpose, probably, the everlasting arm has been beneath
and around them for so many ages, and they have been
preserved from the arts and allurements of the tempter.
For that purpose, probably, they have been led into the
cities and palaces of the Eastern countries.</p>

<p>Where are the seven churches of Asia, to whom was
penned the mystic visions of the Apocalypse? Where are
the splendid cities in which they rose and flourished?
Gone, gone, with the glory of Babylon and the triumphs
of Rome. Where is the church of Laodicea, in whose
gorgeous cathedral the lordly prelates met to give laws to
the Christian world and to anathematize Sabbath-keepers?
Echo might answer, "Where?" since it is only remembered
because consecrated by the historic muse. But the
Sabbath they execrated still exists; is still honoured and
hallowed by large and flourishing churches, whose members
are scattered over all parts of Asia. Churches, who have
never bowed to Baal, who have remained uncorrupted by
Rome, uncontaminated by Mohammedism; who amidst
the darkness of idolatry kept the lamp of Christianity
replenished and burning; and in whose moral firmament
the rays of the Star of Bethlehem have never been obscured.
That the members of these churches possess
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">{32}</a></span>
natural facilities for the propagation of Christianity
throughout the East, that a foreigner could scarcely acquire
by long years spent in toil and study, must be evident
to every discerning mind. But they are ignorant of
the art of printing; and although three editions of their
Bible have been issued at Amsterdam, and another at
Venice, the supply has by no means equalled the demand
among themselves for that holy book. What they require
are facilities for printing. A mission, with printers and
printing-presses, established in the heart of that country,
would prove of incalculable advantage;—not to teach them
Christianity: they are acquainted with its doctrines already;—but
to print their Bible, and other religious books,
for distribution; to enrich their travelling merchants, who
are in continual motion from Canton to Constantinople,
with the precious wares of truth and wisdom; to inspire
their zeal, awaken their energies, and secure their engagement
in the glorious enterprise. Would it not be interesting
to open a communication with these ancient churches,
whose foundation on the Rock cannot be doubted, since
they have withstood the wreck and ruin of eighteen centuries,
neither extinguished by wars and desolations, nor
contaminated by the false prophet or the beast? Would
it not be delightful to hold intercourse with that venerable
patriarch,—the successor of a line of prelates extending
back to the Apostle, that Israelite indeed, in whom was
found no guile? Surely that place is hallowed. Within
sight of Ekmiasin is Mount Ararat, where the world's
gray fathers came forth to witness the bow of the covenant,
and whence the Sun of Righteousness shall yet arise to
the benighted nations with healing in his wings.</p>

<p>The Armenians, though ignorant of the art of printing,
have an abundant store of literature. In the monastery
of Ekmiasin, and in some other places, the accumulated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">{33}</a></span>
lore of ages has been preserved in huge piles of manuscripts,
that would abundantly reward the labours of the scholar
and the antiquarian. They are not ignorant of the belles-lettres,
and they have produced some pleasing poets and
rhetoricians.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_3" id="Ref_3" href="#Foot_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>There are other ancient sects in the East who are represented
as being observant of the ancient Sabbath. Of
these we might instance several branches of the Nestorian
fraternities, the Hemerobaptists, or Christians of St. John,
and the Jusidians. How far this may be the case, I have
no data for determining. Some authors have also ascribed
the observation of the Sabbath to the Greek Church; but
this, I believe, can only be understood in a partial and
limited sense. Many have been guilty of the incongruity
of including in the term "the Greek Church" all the
Christians of the East. Strictly speaking, that term was,
and is, only applicable to those countries in which the spiritual
authority of the Constantinopolitan prelate predominated.</p>

 <small>A SKETCH OF THE HISTORY OF THE ANCIENT CHRISTIANS OF INDIA.</small></h3>

</div>

<p>The introduction, rise, progress, declension, and extirpation
of Christianity in India, is, with some partial exceptions,
wrapped in profound obscurity, yet many historians
of abundant information and unimpeachable veracity
are unanimous in supposing that India received the gospel
probably before Great Britain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">{34}</a></span>
Rev. C. Buchanan says, "There have lately been discovered
Sanscrit writings containing testimony of Christ.
They relate to a prince who reigned about the period of
the Christian era, and whose history, though mixed with
fable, contains particulars which correspond, in a surprising
degree, with the advent, birth, miracles, death,
and resurrection of our Saviour." The same testimony is
given by Sir William Jones, whose acquaintance with Oriental
literature has never been surpassed. Another learned
historian declares, "That it may be proved by the Syriac
records, that in the fourth century Christianity was flourishing
in the provinces of Chorasin and Mavaralhara;
and from a variety of learned testimony, that the gospel
was introduced by the Apostle Thomas himself into India
and China, within thirty years subsequent to the ascension
of our Saviour." La Croze in the clearest manner proves
the antiquity of Christianity in those countries. In the
epitome of the Syrian canons, St. Thomas is styled the
Apostle of the Hindoos. He is uniformly styled, in the
Syrian Chronicles, the first bishop of the East. Ebed Jesus
says, "India and all the regions around received the
priesthood from him." Amru, the Syriac historian, traces
both Thomas and Bartholomew through Arabia and Persia
into India and China. Many of the Syrian writers quoted
by Asseman agree in stating that a few of the twelve, and
many of the seventy disciples went far and wide preaching
the gospel through Northern Asia.</p>

<p>The Bishop of Calcutta, Dr. Wilson, says, "That the
Christians of the Malabar Coast are the remnants of the
ancient church of India, preserved in the midst of idolatry
from the days of the Apostles."</p>

<p>These Christian settlements are located on the Malabar
coast, in the south of India, and contain a population of
probably 200,000. They are agricultural in their mode
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">{35}</a></span>
of life, and occupy a fertile and healthy territory. They
are spread along the Cunara. In Mangalore, Onore,
Barcelore, and Carwar, they have flourishing churches.
A large settlement of these people were discovered by Dr.
Buchanan in the interior of Travancore. Their intelligence,
the virtuous liberty of the female sex, and the
whole aspect of society, seemed to indicate a Protestant
country.</p>

<p>For the compilation of a history of this people we have
scant materials. Unknown to the world they seem to have
been most happily preserved from its troubles and dissensions.
Their obscurity was the preservative of their peace
and the badge of their purity. Yet we are informed by
William of Malmsbury, that these Christians were visited,
towards the conclusion of the ninth century, by ambassadors
from Alfred of England, who paid their homage at
the shrine of St. Thomas, in the vicinity of Madras, and
whose return, loaded with a cargo of pearls and the richest
gums and spices, amply rewarded the enterprising sovereign,
who entertained the noblest projects of discovery
and commerce.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_4" id="Ref_4" href="#Foot_4">[4]</a></span> They asserted that the pepper coast of
Malabar, and even the islands of Ceylon and Socotara,
were peopled with Christians, who were in happy ignorance
of the quarrels of princes and ecclesiastics. And
that the bishops who presided over this multitude of
churches were unambitious of worldly honours, and received
ordination from the patriarch of the East. This
account, however, was received as an imposition upon the
credulity of mankind, and was treated as such until the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">{36}</a></span>
progress of modern discovery established the fact. The
Portuguese, who circumnavigated Africa, and dared the
dangers of unknown seas, in order to gather the Indian
spoils of gold and gems, found, not indeed the boundless
wealth they sought, but these companies of Christians
who still preserved their faith in its pristine purity. Superior
in arts, and arms, and virtues, to the idolaters of
Hindostan, they appeared to the astonished adventurers
like another race. They occupied extremely neat and
convenient dwellings, shaded by the palm-tree, and contiguous
to fields of tropical productions. The husbandman
lived in peace and plenty, the merchant grew rich by the
pepper trade, the young men were admitted to the service
and society of the nobility of Malabar; and their simple
virtues demanded and insured the respect of the king of
Cochin, and the Zamorin himself. They were in allegiance
to a Gentoo sovereign, but the real administration
of their laws, even in temporal concerns, was lodged in
the hands of the bishop of Angumala, who could trace an
uninterrupted succession of prelates to the apostle himself.
He still asserted his ancient dignity as metropolitan of
India, and his jurisdiction extended over fourteen hundred
churches, and embraced the spiritual care of 250,000 souls.
He was assisted by a sufficient number of priests and spiritual
teachers, who administered consolation to the dying,
and reproof or correction to the living. Their meeting-houses
were not different from ordinary dwellings. They
had neither pictures nor images. The doctrine of purgatory,
the invocation of saints, the merit of relics, and the
observation of the first day, was unknown among them.
On the contrary, they rested and attended to divine worship
upon the seventh day of the week, administered baptism
to adults, and by immersion, were not ignorant of the
great doctrines of regeneration and justification, and possessed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">{37}</a></span>
authentic manuscript copies of the Holy Scriptures,
which were publicly read in the churches every ensuing
Sabbath. They were not degenerated into that softness,
effeminacy, and licentiousness of manners, which generally
distinguish the natives of Southern India. They were
chaste, and observant of their conjugal relations; adultery
was a crime unknown. Their priests were permitted to
enter into wedlock once, with a pure virgin; they were
scandalized and disgraced by a second marriage, and a
third could only be consummated at the expense of excommunication.</p>

<p>The Portuguese were no less surprised at their profession
than offended by their simplicity; but, what appeared
most unaccountable, they were unacquainted with the spiritual
and temporal majesty of Rome, and were ignorant
that, to St. Peter's successor, all the kings and prelates of
the earth owed subjection and allegiance. They adhered,
like their ancestors, to the communion of the Nestorian
Patriarch; their bishops had for ages been ordained by
him at Mosul, and thence had traversed the dangers of
sea and land to their dioceses on the coast of Malabar.
Their liturgy and sacred books were in the Syriac idiom.
They were acquainted with the names of Theodore and
Nestorius, were strenuous advocates of the doctrine of the
two persons of Christ, but they manifested a pious horror,
when they heard the appellation "Mother of God" applied
to the Virgin Mary. When her image was first presented
to receive their adoration, they indignantly refused, exclaiming,
"We are Christians, not idolaters; we worship
God." It was the first care of the Romish emissaries to
intercept all correspondence with the Nestorian Patriarch,
to forbid their observance of the Sabbath, and to compel
them to admit the baptism of infants. Their bishops and
leaders were thrown into the dungeons of the Holy Office,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">{38}</a></span>
which, under the auspices of Alexis de Menezes, had been
established, and was in full operation. Their towns were
filled with Portuguese soldiers, their churches with images,
and their pulpits by shaven monks. All the mighty
engines of ecclesiastical authority were brought to bear
upon these defenceless people; all the passions of the
human heart were alternately assailed, in order to consummate
their conversion to the faith of Rome. Is it a
wonder that the shepherdless flock succumbed, at least,
for a time? that where, for ages, the Sabbath had been
observed, strange sounds of secular employment should be
heard upon that holy day? and that the communion,
hitherto regarded as a symbolic memorial of the Saviour's
passion, was accepted as a vicarious sacrifice? "We confess
our sins in prayer to God," they exclaimed, when
commanded to appear, for auricular confession, before the
priesthood. "We keep the Sabbath," they replied, when
told to observe the Dominical day. But ecclesiastical
tyranny prevailed. Menezes, archbishop of Goa, announced
to the synod of Diamper, over which he presided,
that a union between the heretics of St. Thomas and the
Holy Church had been piously consummated, the memories
of Theodore and Nestorius anathematized, and the
see of Angumala bestowed upon a Jesuit, his minion and
the worthy associate of such a prelate. For sixty years
servitude and hypocrisy prevailed. For sixty years the
mass was chanted on the Lord's day, and in an unknown
tongue, in the chapels of Malabar. But the day for their
liberation arrived. The Portuguese empire in the East
was overthrown by the courage and constancy of the
Dutch. Of the latter, the Nestorians proved the most
valuable of allies; and no one acquainted with human
nature can wonder that they were implacable enemies of
the former. The Jesuits, though loth to resign it, were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">{39}</a></span>
incapable of defending the power they had abused. Forty
thousand Christians in arms asserted, by the most powerful
arguments, their rights, and their attachment to the
creed of their ancestors. The Jesuits, with their minions,
fled. The Indian archdeacon was brought from a dungeon
to the episcopal chair, which he filled until a new primate
could be solicited and obtained from the Nestorian patriarch
of the East.</p>

<p>The churches were immediately purged of images and
relics. The observation of the first day was forbidden,
and that of the Sabbath restored. And to crown the
whole, a great procession was formed, in which multitudes
bearing palm-branches, and with all the ensigns of victory
and triumph, repaired to their chapels, singing the Trisagion,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_5" id="Ref_5" href="#Foot_5">[5]</a></span>
where the service was performed in the ancient
manner.</p>

<p>Since the expulsion of the Jesuits the Nestorian creed
has been fully professed on the coast of Malabar, and
these ancient Christians have engaged the speculations of
Europe and the civilized world. Dr. Buchanan represents
their episcopal establishment to be equally respectable with
that of the English in India, and says, moreover, that they
maintain the solemn worship of God in all their churches
upon the seventh day.</p>

<p>Another eminent author says, that "their doctrines are
those of the Bible, and that they have been sorely tried in
times past for keeping the commandments of God."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_6" id="Ref_6" href="#Foot_6">[6]</a></span></p>

 <h3 class="nobreak">SECTION III.<br />
 <small>A SKETCH OF THE HISTORY OF THE ABYSSINIAN CHURCH.</small></h3>

</div>

<p>Abyssinia, or ancient Ethiopia, comprehends a vast
region in the interior parts of Africa, whose inhabitants,
previous to the acquaintance of their Queen with the Jewish
king Solomon, were involved in a dark and gloomy superstition,
resembling in many respects the idolatrous worship
of the Egyptians. The connexion and intimacy that subsequently
existed between the Jewish and Ethiopian courts
resulted in the conversion of this people to Judaism, in
the profession of which they remained until the time of
our Saviour. It is also evident that considerable intercourse
was carried on between Axuma, the capital of
Ethiopia, and the royal city of Judea, no less for commercial
than religious purposes. It is highly probable that
business connected with ecclesiastical affairs, or perhaps
the desire of witnessing and participating in the solemnities
of Pentecost, had induced a dignitary of the Ethiopian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">{41}</a></span>
court to visit Jerusalem, where, coming in contact with
Philip, he was converted to Christianity, and baptized by
that apostle. The subsequent fate of this distinguished
personage, the impression produced upon the mind of his
royal mistress and her court by his conversion, or whether
the propagation of Christianity throughout the realm was
effected by his instrumentality, are all mysteries over
which time has drawn an impenetrable veil.</p>

<p>Ecclesiastical historians are united in their testimony
that, early in the fourth century, Christianity became the
established religion of the empire. This happy result was
brought about by a train of singular circumstances. It
appears that Meropius, a merchant of Tyre, having undertaken
a commercial voyage to India, was shipwrecked on
the coast of Ethiopia, when he was barbarously murdered
by the natives, and his two sons carried as slaves
before the Emperor. The intelligence, gentleness, and
peaceable demeanour of the two brothers, of whom the
older was named Frumentius, gained them many friends,
and they were soon promoted to high offices at court.
The brothers, being Christians, soon began to teach the
natives, and the work of conversion went on rapidly. In
a few years, so great was their success, that the gospel
had been preached throughout the length and breadth of
the land, and a thriving branch thereby united to the
great Eastern church. Frumentius subsequently visited
the Patriarch of Alexandria, who received him and the
message he bore with the greatest joy, loaded him with
honours, and consecrated him the first bishop of the Ethiopians.
The system of doctrine was the same as that
received in the Alexandrian Church, of which Athanasius
gives a very succinct account. This venerable prelate was
a decided opposer of the Arian heresy, and he expresses
their belief in the divinity of our Saviour; "And we assemble
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">{42}</a></span>
on Saturday," he continues; "not that we are
infected with Judaism, but to worship Jesus, the Lord of
the Sabbath." The friendly relation thus early begun
between these churches, has continued to the present time
through fifteen centuries; and the office of Patriarch of
the Ethiopic Church is still bestowed upon a Coptish
priest, who receives his appointment and consecration from
the Patriarch of Alexandria.</p>

<p>The Abyssinian Church appears to have remained in a
state of general peace and prosperity while Numidia, Carthage,
and other African provinces, were convulsed by the
faction of the Donatists. Neither do they appear to have
taken any part in the tumults and dissensions arising from
the Arian and Sabellian controversies. On the contrary,
they were counted by the most rigid as a church of orthodox
Christians, until the commencement of the seventh
century, when they embraced the Eutychian sentiments,
in consequence, it is said, of the exhortations addressed
to them by the doctors of that sect who resided in Egypt.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_7" id="Ref_7" href="#Foot_7">[7]</a></span>
About the same time, the Saracens subduing Egypt and
all the adjacent countries, Abyssinia became isolated from
the rest of the world. During the many centuries that
ensued, Christianity, though not without adulteration,
was preserved in this ancient empire, and the solemn
observance of the seventh day unchangeably continued.
Toward the close of the fifteenth century, the Portuguese,
through their brilliant career of maritime discovery, succeeded
in opening a communication into the country of
the Abyssinians, who were found observing the rites and
professing the doctrine of their ancient faith. Rome, inflamed
with a bigoted zeal to extend the sphere of her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">{43}</a></span>
spiritual triumphs, early took advantage of so favourable
an opportunity to establish a mission in this remote quarter
of the globe. Accordingly, John Bermudez, one of the
most enterprising and crafty of the sons of Loyola, was
despatched into Abyssinia, and in order to give his mission
a certain appearance of dignity, he was consecrated patriarch
of that people by the Pope. According to his own
accounts of the matter, he found them sunk in the most
deplorable state of heresy and ignorance, observant of
Judaical rites and ceremonies, and unacquainted with the
ritual and worship of the true church. As Bermudez was
accompanied by an embassage from the Portuguese court,
who expressed the most solicitous regard for the Abyssinian
monarch, that prince, hoping to derive some signal
advantage from such powerful succours, that would enable
him to terminate successfully a war in which he was at
that time engaged with a neighbouring prince, received
them most graciously, and everything seemed for a time
to presage the most happy termination of the mission.
But their sanguine expectations were doomed to disappointment,
and though they were several times reinforced,
and neither pains nor expense were spared in the prosecution
of their enterprise, it became ultimately apparent
to all that the Abyssinians were not to be engaged to
abandon their ancient faith, and the Jesuits becoming weary
of such fruitless endeavours, relinquished the enterprise
and returned to Europe. But the Pope, unwilling to renounce
his pretensions in that quarter of the world, took
occasion to renew the embassy about the commencement of
the seventeenth century. As before, the mission received
at first the most auspicious encouragement from Susneius,
or Segued, the reigning monarch. This prince, whose right
to the throne was fiercely contested by some powerful
adversaries, gladly embraced their overtures. Alphonsa
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">{44}</a></span>
Mendez, through the exercise of that consummate cunning
for which his order is proverbial, succeeded in securing to
himself the appointment of prime minister of the realm,
and of patriarch of the Abyssinians. The monarch, also,
in an open and public manner, swore allegiance to the
Pope, and issued a decree commanding all his subjects to
embrace the Romish faith under penalty of confiscation,
mutilation, and death. The execution of this barbarous
decree was committed to Mendez, the new patriarch, who
commenced his mission by the most inconsiderate acts of
violence and oppression. Displaying in all his conduct
the true spirit of the Spanish Inquisition, he employed all
the arts of persuasion and reward on the one hand, and of
terror and cruelty on the other, to compel the Abyssinians
to abandon the tenets of their forefathers, and to adopt
the doctrine and worship of Rome. In this fearful alternative,
multitudes of that people, with their priests and
leaders, steadfastly adhered to the truth, with a firmness
and magnanimity that would have done honour to the
primitive ages, and resolutely met death in its most frightful
forms. Popular insurrections succeeded, and force was
called in to produce submission. Multitudes were slaughtered,
and many driven into exile. At last, however, the
inhuman work of persecution disgusted the emperor; and
after a great victory over twenty thousand of his peasantry,
in which eight thousand were slain, he relinquished
the bloody task, and by a proclamation, distinguished for
its frankness and simplicity, restored religious freedom to
Abyssinia.</p>

<p>The result is gratifying as a triumph of religious liberty,
and as a check to the extension of Roman despotism and
superstition. To attempt any details of the miseries and
sufferings which the Abyssinians had endured during this
persecution, would require volumes; for beside the horrors of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">{45}</a></span>
the Inquisition and the evils of civil war, the worst passions
and vices of mankind, as an unavoidable consequence, were
released from all restraint. Intrepid avarice took occasion
to extort and pillage from its miserable victims; revenge
wreaked the hoarded hatred of years upon its unsuspecting
objects; and the assassin and the ravisher proceeded,
without fear of punishment, to the consummation of their
crimes.</p>

<p>Mendez had, likewise, ordered those to be re-baptized,
who, in compliance with the will of the emperor, embraced
the religion of Rome, as if they had formerly been the
votaries of Paganism, and their worship a system of idolatry.
They were also compelled to renounce the observance
of the seventh day. This the Abyssinian clergy regarded
as a most shocking insult to the religious discipline of
their forefathers, and quite as provoking as the violence
and barbarity exercised upon those who refused to submit
to the Romish yoke. Besides his arbitrary and despotic
proceedings in the church, Mendez excited tumults and
dissensions in the state, and with an unparalleled spirit of
aggression and arrogance, encroached upon the prerogatives
of the crown, and even attempted to give law to the emperor
himself. Many circumstances, indeed, concur to
favour the opinion that he entertained the design of subverting
the liberties of the empire, and rendering it an
appendage of the Portuguese crown. At any rate, the
kingdom became torn to pieces by intestine commotions
and conspiracies, and though obliged to carry on his machinations
in secret, he filled the court with cabals which
lasted until the death of the reigning monarch, in 1632.
Basilides, the son and successor of the former, deemed it
expedient to free the country from such troublesome guests,
and accordingly, in 1684, he banished Mendez, with all
the Europeans belonging to his train, from the Abyssinian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">{46}</a></span>
territories, commanded all his subjects to return to the
religion of their ancestors, and forbid the worship of
images, or the observance of the first day. He likewise
requested the Patriarch of Alexandria to send them a new
abuna, with which request that dignitary complied.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_8" id="Ref_8" href="#Foot_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p>The condition of the Abyssinian church at this time
was most deplorable. The reign of the Jesuits, though
short, had been attended with blighting and fatal consequences.
It had been their aim to overthrow in the minds
of the people all respect for the moral law and the revealed
word of God, and to establish in its place a preposterous
veneration for the authority of the fathers, and the canons
of the church. Nor was this all; superstition had immeasurably
increased, and its accompaniments, vice and ignorance,
everywhere prevailed.</p>

<p>But from this period the very name of Rome, its worship,
or its pontiffs, were objects of the highest aversion to
the Abyssinians; and even the frontiers of the kingdom
were guarded with the strictest vigilance and the closest
attention, lest any Jesuit or Romish emissary might steal
into their territory in disguise, and excite new commotions
in the kingdom. In vain the pontiffs made many attempts
to recover what they had lost through the insolence and
misconduct of the Jesuits. For this purpose two Capuchin
monks were despatched into Abyssinia; but these unfortunate
wretches only succeeded in penetrating a short distance
into the interior, when they were discovered and
immediately put to death. The pontiffs, however, were
not discouraged, though they employed more clandestine
methods of reviving the missions, and even solicited in
their behalf the intercession and influence of Louis XIV.
of France. The Jesuits were eager to obtain this employment,
and, accordingly, Poncet, a French apothecary, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">{47}</a></span>
despatched from Cairo by the consul Maillet, in company
with Brevedent, a respectable member of the former fraternity.
Brevedent died in Abyssinia, and, soon after,
Poncet obtained an introduction to the king, who expressed
his dislike of the Catholic religion, and his determination
not to permit his people to embrace it. M. Du Roule was
afterwards deputed to the same court, but he had advanced
no further than Sennaar, when he was cruelly murdered
by the natives, at the instigation, as was supposed, of the
Franciscans, who were disgusted at seeing the mission in
the hands of the Jesuits. In 1709, the throne was usurped
by Ousts, who appears to have been well affected to the
Romish system, and who secretly communed with its emissaries,
although he made no attempt to influence the consciences
of his subjects. His successor, David, ordered
three of these strangers to be apprehended, who, being
condemned as heretics and schismatics in a council of the
clergy, were stoned to death. Since that period, Pope
Benedict XIV. made a new attempt to effect a reconciliation
with the Abyssinian church, but his efforts proved
abortive; and, so far as I am aware, neither the pontiffs
nor their votaries have been able to calm the resentment
of that exasperated people, or to subdue their enmity
against the doctrine and worship of Rome.</p>

<p>In 1634, the Lutherans made several attempts to establish
missions in Abyssinia, in order, as they said, to bring
that benighted people to the knowledge of a purer religion,
and a more rational system of worship, although it might
appear questionable to some which church of the two most
required a reformation in its rites and doctrines. In
accordance with this design, the learned Heyling of Lubec
made a voyage into Abyssinia, where he resided many
years, and acquired such a distinguished place in the confidence
and esteem of the sovereign, that he was honoured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">{48}</a></span>
with many important offices, and finally became prime
minister of the realm. In this eminent station he acquitted
himself in the most creditable manner, and gave many
proofs of his zeal both for the interests of religion and the
public good. He finally set out for Europe on business of
importance, but never arrived there; and, as the journey
was being performed by land, it is supposed that he
perished in the deserts of Nubia. Subsequently, however,
a communication was kept up between the two countries,
and Ernest, duke of Saxe-Gotha, surnamed the Pious, on
account of his sanctity and virtue, made new attempts to
diffuse a knowledge of the gospel, as taught in his church,
among the Abyssinians. This design was formed through
the counsels of the famous Ludolph, and was to have been
executed by the ministry of Gregory, an Abyssinian abbot
who had resided some time in Europe. This missionary
sailed from Antwerp, in the ship Katerina, in 1657, but, in
passing Cape Horn, she was unfortunately wrecked, and
all on board perished. The mission, thus frustrated, was
not designed to be abandoned; for the prince, in 1663,
entrusted the same important commission to John Michael
Wansleb, a native of Erfurt, to whom he gave the wisest
instructions, and whom he charged particularly to employ
all rational and consistent means to excite in the Abyssinian
nation a favourable opinion of the Germans, as
this, more than anything else, would contribute to the
success of the enterprise. But this wise and laudable
undertaking failed through the inconstancy of the worthless
man to whom it was confided, and whose virtue was by
no means equal to his ability. Instead of continuing his
journey into Abyssinia, he remained for some time in
Egypt, and finally returned to Europe without ever seeing
the country he was intended to visit. But he entertained
many uneasy apprehensions of the account that would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">{49}</a></span>
naturally be demanded of his conduct, and of the manner
in which he had expended the large sums of money designed
for the Abyssinian expedition. These apprehensions,
together with the consciousness of guilt, made him
desperate. Hence, instead of returning to Germany, he
went to Rome, and, in 1667, embraced the doctrine of
that church, at least in open profession, and entered into
the Dominican order.</p>

<p>Other missions have been established, or rather attempted,
in this country. In 1829, Messrs. Gobat and Kinglar
were sent by the Church Missionary Society, as missionaries
to Abyssinia. After many trials, they succeeded in
reaching the place of their destination, by way of Massowa.
The ruler of Tigre, who is greatly beloved by his
subjects, received them in a friendly manner, and they
were much encouraged by his assurances of safety and
protection. Mr. Hinglar died when he had just conquered
most of the difficulties of the language, but Mr. Gobat
employed his time in conversational preaching and distributing
Bibles, until, in consequence of the unsettled state
of the country, he was induced to leave for a short time.
It is a fact, however, that previous to this the Scriptures
had been translated by the Abyssinians themselves from
the Arabic and Ethiopic into the Amharic language, which
is the dialect generally spoken throughout the Abyssinian
empire. In 1833, Mr. Gobat, accompanied by Mr. Isenberg,
returned to his field of labour. They took up their
residence at Adowa, the capital of Tigre, six or eight days'
journey from Massowa. During Mr. Gobat's absence, the
former monarch, Sabagadis, had been dethroned, and
Oobie, an avaricious and cruel despot, reigned in his stead.
It was soon perceived that he regarded the missionaries
with a jealous eye, and his suspicions were increased by
the appearance in the country soon after of many foreigners.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">{50}</a></span>
Mr. Isenberg was openly accused of bringing them into
the country for treasonable purposes. These accusations,
and others of a similar character, were circulated by the
priests, who complained that through the influence of the
missionaries the Ethiopic church was threatened with
extinction. They also charged the missionaries with intrigue
to overthrow the government of the country, and to
introduce English troops. Oobie was no less suspicious of
the political designs of the foreigners, and it was not long
before an edict came to Mr. Isenberg, from the king, in
which all foreigners were commanded to embrace the Abyssinian
creed or to leave the country. Preferring the latter
alternative, Mr. Isenberg and his associate, Mr. Blumhardt,
retired into Egypt. Mr. Krapf, a former companion
of Blumhardt, removed to Shoa, where he was favourably
received and hospitably entertained for a time. Ultimately,
however, it appeared that the king wished to be
benefited by the superior knowledge of the missionaries in
everything but what pertained to the duties of religion.
He said that he wanted workmen, not priests. After Mr.
Krapf had acquired the language, he established schools,
which succeeded well for a time, or until the pupils, from
their superior knowledge of the Holy Scriptures, began to
question the traditions in which they had been brought up.
Here the priesthood interfered, and through their machinations
the monarch was induced to express his decided
disapprobation of the proceedings, and the schools were,
at his command, suppressed. Under these discouragements,
the missionaries, after distributing ten thousand
copies of the Bible, returned to Europe.</p>

<p>The empire of Abyssinia has been frequently disturbed
by civil wars; and the appointment of a new abuna, or
metropolitan, is often attended by intestine commotions.
This was the case in 1715, when that dignitary, in a convocation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">{51}</a></span>
of the clergy, declared his opinion of the consubstantiality
of Christ, which was different from that which
had been proclaimed at the gate of the palace. The abuna
represented Christ as being "one God, of the Father alone,
with a body consubstantial with ours, and by that union
becoming the Messiah." The emperor maintained, on the
contrary, that the Redeemer was perfect man and perfect
God by the union; one Christ, whose body was composed
of a precious substance, called <i>bahery</i>, not derived from
his mother, or consubstantial with ours. Many of the
ecclesiastics favoured the opinion of the abuna; and, elate
with their supposed triumph, they gathered the populace,
surrounded the palace, and insulted the emperor with shouts
and songs. The enraged potentate gave immediate orders
for their dispersion and punishment. The mandate was
executed by a company of pagan soldiers, who slew about
one hundred of the delinquents, and filled the streets of
the capital with slaughter. The Christian population of
Shoa and Efat is estimated at 1,000,000 souls, and that
of the Pagan and Mohammedan population of the numerous
dependencies at an equal number. But this people is
chiefly interesting to us from the fact that here, for so
many ages, a national religious establishment has existed,
which never succumbed to the authority of Rome, and,
consequently, which has ever been in the observation of
the holy Sabbath day.</p>

<p>The Ethiopic church maintains the Eutychian doctrine
respecting the nature of Christ; and it agrees with the
other Eastern churches in holding the procession of the
Holy Ghost from the Father only. In these respects it
differs from the Western churches. From the Romish
church it is distinguished by its doctrine regarding the
supremacy of the Pope, in which it agrees with Protestants;
to the rule of faith, which it limits to the Scriptures, including
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">{52}</a></span>
the Apocrypha; to the eucharist, which it administers in
both kinds to the laity, and regards neither as a transubstantiation
nor as a sacrifice; to the celibacy of the clergy,
who may be married; to the adoration of images, which
it regards as unlawful; to the state of the soul after death,
rejecting purgatory; and as regards several other less
important and minor points. But, like Rome, it invokes
saints and angels as intercessors with God, paying great
honours to the Virgin and St. Michael, and having a
copious calendar of saints, with a corresponding number
of fasts and festivals.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_9" id="Ref_9" href="#Foot_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>Their most extraordinary peculiarities are certain forms
and ceremonies retained from their ancient Jewish worship.
Their churches, which are generally small and mean, resemble
precisely the Jewish temple. Like it, they are
divided into three parts; the innermost being the holy of
holies, and inaccessible to the laity, who, except on certain
occasions, are forbidden to pass the outer porch. Unbelievers,
and all subject to Levitical uncleanness, are
carefully excluded. All who enter must be barefoot, and
the doorposts and threshold must be kissed in passing.
The service is performed in the ancient Ethiopic, or Geez,
now a dead language. It commences with the Jewish Trisagion,
and as David danced before the ark, so their priests
caper and beat the ground with their feet, and, with other
similar antics and performances, complete a remarkable
form of devotion. They observe the Levitical prohibitions
of unclean animals, and the Pharisaical ceremonies of genuflexions
and ablutions. Like the Jews, they practise
concubinage. Fasts of unexampled strictness and extraordinary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">{53}</a></span>
frequency are constantly observed. With scriptural
examples before them, and unenlightened by science
and philosophy, it is perhaps not surprising that they
should believe in witchcraft, magic, and sorcery.</p>

<p>The whole country is overspread to excess with churches,
and the number of the professedly religious in Shoa amounts
to one-fourth of the population. The aboon, or abuna, is
the ecclesiastical head, and the church confines to his hands
alone the grace or virtue that makes a clergyman, differing
in this from other churches called apostolic, which allow
it to all bishops.</p>

<p>The Grand Prior of the monks of Debra Libanos is
second in dignity; then the bishops; next the priests and
deacons. Monasteries abound, and they are generally
placed on eminences near running water, and amid scenes
of beauty and sublimity. An easy ceremony admits to
the monkish order, and the life of the professed is one of
ease and indulgence, consequently the land swarms with
monks, who are in reality the greatest of pests and plagues.
Every church establishment is supported by certain lands
and villages particularly set apart for that purpose, and to
these are added various fees for baptismal, funeral, and
other clerical services, besides the voluntary contributions
of the superstitious people. These ecclesiastics, taken as
a body, are ignorant, superstitious, and immoral, fearful of
innovation, hating heretics, and observant of religious
forms, some with the sincerity of devotees, and others as
the business-like followers of a gainful profession. Of the
doctrines of justification by faith or regeneration by the
Holy Spirit, the Abyssinians are said to be entirely ignorant;
but it is possible, it is even probable, that there has
been some misapprehension upon that point. It is very
easy for foreigners, in a state of society so new and strange,
to misapprehend the purport of what they behold, or to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">{54}</a></span>
arrive at wrong conclusions, from given premises, in consequence
of prejudice and partiality. We trust that the Divine
Inhabitant has not entirely forsaken this polluted temple,
and that the sacred fire is not utterly extinguished, although
the surrounding atmosphere may be impure. At any rate,
there is hope, since the Scriptures are the foundation of
the faith of the Abyssinian Church, and there is no infallible
pontiff, consecrating with his authority the manifold
corruptions from which that authority sprung, and by
which it is perpetuated.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to repeat what all authors acquainted
with the subject have been unanimous in affirming,
namely, that the Abyssinian Church observes the
seventh-day Sabbath. Sandius says, "There is a Christian
empire of the Abyssinians, who adhere to Peter and Paul,
and observe the seventh day." The Jesuits affirmed "that
they kept as sacred the Jewish Sabbath." Mr. Brerewood,
who wrote in 1614, declares that the midland Ethiopians,
the modern Abyssinians, reverenced the Sabbath, keeping
it solemn equal with the Lord's day.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_10" id="Ref_10" href="#Foot_10">[10]</a></span> James Bruce, a
Scotsman, who visited Abyssinia in 1768, testifies to their
observance of the seventh day; and these accounts have
been substantiated by the witness of modern travellers.
The numerous dependencies of the Abyssinian empire, as
well as some of the neighbouring independent kingdoms,
contain Christian communities, of which some much nearer
than others approximate in their rites and ceremonies to
the simplicity of the apostolic age. Many of these have
for a long period of years, successfully held their position
among mountain fastnesses in the very midst of a Pagan
and Mohammedan population. One of the most remarkable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">{55}</a></span>
of these seats is upon an island of the Lake Zovai,
where, in the Church of Emanuel, are deposited the silver
dishes and other sacred utensils, with numerous manuscripts,
which Nebla Dengel wished particularly to preserve
from the grasp of an invading army. The islands
of this lake contain upwards of three thousand Christian
houses formed of lime and stone. They are shaded by
lofty trees, and the whole has a luxuriant and beautiful
appearance. In Guragee, a dependency of Abyssinia, the
population are exclusively Christian. Twelve isolated
churches previously unheard of were discovered a few
years since in a province called Yoya. Between Garro
and Metcha there is a small tract peopled by Christians,
who reside entirely in mountain caves, as a measure of
security against the heathens by whom they are surrounded.
Eight days' journey hence is Cambat, an independent Christian
state, completely studded with churches and monasteries.
Wollamo, another Christian province under an independent
sovereign, lies below Cambat, and also contains
many religious houses. Skorchassie, another neighbouring
state, is peopled by Christians, and so is Sidama, and both
are entirely surrounded by Pagans. Susa is another important
Christian country, whose king, in 1842, was said to
be a very wise and just ruler. The government is liberal,
and the people are, comparatively with the other African
nations, in a high state of civilization. The priests are
distinguished by antique robes and silver mitres, and the
churches and religious observances resemble those of Shoa,
except as regards the saints' days, most of which are unknown
in Susa. In this country all labour is interdicted
upon the Sabbath, but the observation of any Lord's day
is unknown.</p>

<p>That the religion of Ethiopia should have become corrupt
is not in the least surprising, although we can only
refer it to the superintending providence of God that, amid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">{56}</a></span>
the wreck of ages and the changes and revolutions of time,
it has survived at all. The wonder is, that, surrounded as
they are by Pagan and Moslem, together with the corrupt
propensities of the human heart, the very name and profession
of Christianity has not been long since obliterated
from their minds, the Sabbath forgotten, and the name of
the Great Mediator supplanted by that of the false prophet.</p>

<p>Abyssinia, notwithstanding her corruptions, is immeasurably
above all other African nations in the scale of civilization.
This is plainly enough proved by the following
extract from the Narrative of the Travels of Charles Johnston,
through the country of Adel to the kingdom of Shoa,
in 1842-43:</p>

<p>"Arrived upon the summit, the stranger finds an extensive
table-land spread out before him, and he cannot divest
himself of the idea that he has reached some new continent.
A Scotch climate and Scotch vegetation, wheat,
barley, linseed,—and yet in intertropical Africa. The
country seems highly cultivated, wheat and barley on all
sides growing close to our path, while near the farmhouses
were stacks of grain, which gave the whole country
an English appearance.</p>

<p>"Amidst the luxuries and conveniences so abundantly
supplied to the embassy by the indulgent care of a liberal
government, I almost fancied that I had returned to the
comforts of European life."</p>

<p>Mr. Johnston says that he was furnished with excellent
wheaten bread, and butter quite as good as any he had
ever eaten, with fish, flesh, fowl, wine, honey, and a kind
of native beer, resembling English ale. He speaks of the
king as being beloved by his people, remarkably just in
all his transactions, moderate in his anger, and benevolent
to his visiters. He himself declared that he had "the fear
of God before his eyes."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">{57}</a></span>
The Holy Scriptures have been preserved in Abyssinia,
on parchment manuscript, and in the Geez language; but,
in 1826, they were translated by the Ethiopians themselves
into Amharic, the spoken dialect of the country. These
books, our traveller declares, agree perfectly with the Vulgate,
except the book of the Maccabees, in which he discovered
some discrepancies. They also possess a commentary
on each of the sacred books, and, besides the five books
of Moses, possess a sixth, which they equally revere. The
names of the books agree with ours, and appear to be
Ethiopic translations of Genesis, Exodus, &amp;c. They also
possess the book of Enoch, which, however, according to
Mr. Bruce, is the production of a Gnostic philosopher.
They have a liturgy in Ethiopic. It is said that all the
literature of the country is embraced in 120 volumes.</p>

<p>But we trust that great and good things are in store for
this ancient people, who, though severely tried and tempted,
have persisted in keeping the commandments of God
and the faith of Jesus; who, though stumbling, have not
wandered altogether out of the way; and who have within
themselves all the elements for moral renovation,—the
Holy Scriptures, the Sabbath, and the knowledge of the
Redeemer of mankind.<span class="fnanchor"><a

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">{58}</a></span>
Abyssinia, as an empire, has experienced alternately
the contraction and expansion common to the ancient
monarchies. The Negus, as friend and ally of Justinian,
reigned supreme over seven kingdoms, prosecuted an extensive
trade with Ceylon and the Indies, and encouraged
in his country the arts and letters of Europe. Arabia,
surnamed "the blest," and, by contrast with the neighbouring
regions, considered as "happy," had been despoiled
of her rich treasures, and led in captivity, to gratify the
avarice or ambition of an Ethiopian conqueror, whose
hereditary claim, founded on his descent from the beauteous
Queen of Sheba, was warmed and animated by religious
zeal. The inhabitants of Arabia were denominated
Homerites. Their prince, Duncan, was not insensible to
the inflictions, nor inflexible to the entreaties, of the Jews,
who, powerful even in exile, persuaded him to retaliate
upon the Christians in his dominions the persecution that
their people suffered from the imperial laws. Accordingly
some Roman merchants were ignominiously put to death,
and the crown of martyrdom bestowed upon many Christians
of Yemen, who refused to apostatize from their faith.
The expiring churches of Arabia invoked the name of the
Abyssinian monarch, who arose like a lion out of his place,
passed the Red Sea with a fleet and army, dethroned the
Jewish proselyte, and extinguished a royal race who, for
many centuries, had exercised sovereignty over the sequestered
region of precious gums and aromatic groves. The
cities of Arabia immediately resounded with the Trisagion,
chanted, with rapturous demonstrations of joy, by the
conquering army. The Negus himself despatched a messenger
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">{59}</a></span>
to the Alexandrian prelate, announcing the victory
of the gospel, and soliciting of that dignitary an orthodox
ruler for the Arabian churches. To Justinian, this announcement
occasioned much secret gratulation, though it
may be questioned by posterity whether he exulted most
in the triumph of orthodoxy, or the flattering prospects he
thereby entertained of gratifying his ambition, securing a
fortunate ally, and reaping the advantages of a lucrative
commercial intercourse. He was desirous to divert the
trade of the precious commodities of the East,—silk, balm,
and frankincense,—no less than to engage the forces of
Arabia and Africa against the Persian king. Accordingly,
an embassage, under the direction of Nonnosus, was despatched
into Abyssinia, to execute, in the name of the
Emperor, this important commission. Declining the shorter
but more dangerous route through the desert regions of
Nubia, he ascended the Nile, embarked on the Red Sea,
and safely landed at the port of Adulis.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_12" id="Ref_12" href="#Foot_12">[12]</a></span> From this port
to the royal city of Axuma is no more than fifty leagues,
in a direct line; but the winding passes of the mountains
detained the embassage fifteen days, during which journey
they were astonished by the droves of wild elephants that
roamed the forests. He found the capital large and populous,
the people Christian in profession, and strictly observant
of the Jewish Sabbath. He found also many traces
of Grecian art.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_13" id="Ref_13" href="#Foot_13">[13]</a></span> The Negus received the ambassador
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">{60}</a></span>
with the splendid hospitality suitable to a potent monarch,
and due to the representative of an imperial friend.
Amidst a numerous and august assemblage of the ladies of
the court, the dignitaries of the church, and the princes of
the empire, the Negus gave audience in a spacious plain.
Dismounting from his lofty chariot, to which was harnessed
four white elephants, superbly caparisoned, he appeared,
clad in a linen garment, with a golden tiara on his head;
while around his neck, arms, and ankles, blazed the regal
circlets of diamonds, pearls, and precious stones, interwoven
with chains of gold. He carried two javelins of rarest
temper, and wore a light shield of exquisite workmanship.
The ambassador of Justinian approached with awe, and
knelt with becoming deference. He was raised and embraced
by the Negus, who received the imperial missive
of which he was the bearer, kissed the seal, perused the
contents with apparent satisfaction, accepted the imperial
alliance, and, brandishing his weapons, denounced a perpetual
anathema against the enemies of his new friend and
ally. But the proposal for trade was artfully eluded, and
the hostile demonstration was not productive of a corresponding
effect. The Abyssinians were unwilling to
abandon the pleasures and luxuries of peace, with the
sensual delights of their aromatic bowers, for the toils of
ambition and the benefit of a foreign potentate. Discretion
is certainly the better part of valour, and it was
proved in the sequel that the Negus, instead of extending
his triumphs, was incapable of preserving what he had
already obtained. The sceptre of Arabia was wrenched
from his hands by Abrahah, the slave of a Roman merchant
of Adulis. The Ethiopian legions were seduced and
enervated by the luxurious influences of the climate. Justinian
solicited the friendship of the usurper, who returned
his complaisancy with a slight tribute and the acknowledgment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">{61}</a></span>
of his nominal supremacy. After a long course
of prosperity, the dynasty of Abrahah was overthrown,
his descendants despoiled of their rich possessions by the
Persian conqueror, and every vestige of Christianity
obliterated. This short episode of Abyssinian history
must be interesting to us, from the fact that, could a
Christian empire have been sustained in Arabia, it might
have prevented the rise of the Mohammedan imposture,
and have materially changed the history of the world.<span class="fnanchor"><a

According to Assemanni, Christianity was once professed by the
horde of Koraites; and their chief, who received ordination, which
probably gave rise to the legend of Presbyter, or Prester, John.</p>

Some modern theorists have severely reprehended the Paulicians,
or Armenians, for the part they bore in these sanguinary scenes. But
so long as the principle of patriotism is cherished; so long as the names
of home and country are accounted sacred; and so long as the memories
of Tell, and Wallace, and Washington, are held up to general emulation,
the laity, at least, may be excused for recognising the legitimacy of
self-defence.</p>

I am aware that the truth of this statement has been questioned,
but after all there is nothing so very improbable in it. Alfred was
a prince of an enterprising disposition, and might have sent an embassy

was no impossibility.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_6" id="Foot_6" href="#Ref_6">[6]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Authors are far from being unanimous in their accounts of this
people and their origin. It has been maintained by not a few that
they are of Syriac extraction, and that the St. Thomas, from whom
their appellation is derived, was an Armenian merchant and missionary
who flourished as their leader in the fifth century. Others, with equal
plausibility, contend that they originated from a colony of Abyssinians.
Dr. Buchanan maintains an opinion different from either. He supposes
them to be natives of India, whose ancestors were converted by St. Thomas,
the Apostle. He says, that "we have as good reason for
believing that St. Thomas died in India, as that St. Peter died at
Rome."</p>

<p>According to a tradition of the natives, the Apostle came first to
Socotara, an island in the Arabian Sea, and thence departed to Cranganor,
where he founded several churches. The next scene of his
labours was Coromandare, and preaching in all the towns and villages
he came to Melsapour, the chief city, where he converted the prince
and a great part of the nobility to the Christian faith. This so enraged
the Brahmins, that one of them secretly followed him into a solitary
place, where he retired for prayer, and stabbed him in the back with
a spear.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_7" id="Foot_7" href="#Ref_7">[7]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
According to another account, their conversion to this creed was
effected by the missionaries of the Empress Theodora, which, however,
has been disputed by Assemanus.</p>

The Abyssinians still retain the physiognomy and olive complexion
of the Arabs, and afford an incontestable evidence that three thousand
years can neither change the colour nor the intellectual capabilities of
the human species. Under the burning sun of Africa, the Abyssinian,
a branch of the great Caucasian family, has preserved the name and
semblance of Christianity and civilization through the wreck and revolutions
of ages, and amid the tempests of foreign and domestic dominations.
Conscious of his ignorance, he once sought the fraternity of
Europe for the sake of her letters and her arts. But how is it with
the Nubian, whose unequivocal African descent is betrayed by his
stupid features, black colour, and woolly hair, yet who enjoyed equal
or superior advantages in ancient times? The history of his race
would attest to the truth in this case. He has relapsed into that barbarism
which seems to be his native element, and from which he appears
incapable of preserving himself. The only memorials of his Christianity
are a few words, of which he is incapable of understanding the
sense; the only traces of his civilization a few heaps of sculptured
ruins.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_12" id="Foot_12" href="#Ref_12">[12]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The negotiations of Justinian with the Abyssinians are mentioned
by Procopius, John Malala, and others. The original narrative of the
ambassador Nonnosus is quoted by the Historian of Antioch, and Photius
has given a curious extract. Justinian reigned over the Greek
empire from 527 to 565.</p>

The present village of Anuma is conspicuous by the ruins of a
splendid Christian temple, and seventeen obelisks, of Grecian architecture.
According to Alvarez, it was in a flourishing state in 1520, but
was ruined the same year by the Turkish invasion.</p>

Those who desire to form an acquaintance with Abyssinian history
may consult Procopius, Baronius, Cosmos, Indicopleustus, Alvarez,
Lobo, and Bruce. In these works, the subject is very amply and ably
treated.</p>

 <small>WALDENSES, ALBIGENSES, PASAGINIANS, ETC.—THEIR
 SABBATICAL CHARACTER EXAMINED.</small></h3>

</div>

<p><span class="smc">It</span> is not my design to give even an abridged account of
ecclesiastical affairs as connected with this people during
the many centuries of their existence, but confine myself
to a consideration of the origin of their distinguishing
appellation, with an account of their doctrinal sentiments
and religious practices, and their terrible persecutions and
dispersion.</p>

<p>It is evident that the Latin word vallis has been the
parent of the English word valley, the French and Spanish
valle, the Provençal vaux, vaudois, the Italian valdesi, the
low Dutch valleye, and the ecclesiastical Valdensis, Valdenses,
and Waldenses. The designation of the word is
valleys—inhabitants of valleys—neither more nor less.
There being no <i>w</i> in the Latin language, the terms Vallenses
and Valdenses were employed long before the more
modern one of Waldenses came into use.</p>

<p>It appears that from the earliest ages, the inhabitants
of the valleys about the Pyrenees did not profess the
Catholic faith; neither was it embraced by the inhabitants
of the valleys of the Alps; it occurred, also, that one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">{63}</a></span>
Valdo, in the ninth century, a friend and adviser of
Berengarius, and a man of wealth, talents, and piety, who
had many followers, possessed himself of a Bible, by which
he was led to perceive the errors and corruptions of Rome,
which he severely denounced; moreover, it came to pass
that about one hundred and thirty years after, a rich merchant
of Lyons, whose name was Waldo, openly withdrew
from the communion of Rome, and supported many to
travel and teach the doctrines believed in the valleys.
All these people, though different in their origin, and different
no doubt in some minor points of faith and practices
of worship, were called Waldenses as a general term. They
had also other appellations imposed upon them, which,
however, were mostly local, and which I shall subsequently
take into consideration. This accounts in a satisfactory
manner for the diversity of the statements concerning
them. In Languedoc these heresies were supposed to be
of recent origin, and to have originated from Waldo,
whose immediate followers were called Waldenses. This,
however, was merely the renovation of the name from a
particular cause, and not its original; for we find that, in
other districts, other branches of this same original sect
are called by other appellations, significative of some distinguished
leader. Thus, in Dauphiny, they were called
Josephists, and, in other places, Petrobrusians, from Peter
De Bruys. Sometimes they received their names from their
manners, as Catharists (Puritans), Bonne Homines (good
men); at others, from the peculiarities of their religious
ordinances, as insabbathists (sabbath-keepers), and Sabbatharians,
because they contended for the observance of the original
sabbath, and denied the real presence of Christ in the
eucharist.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_15" id="Ref_15" href="#Foot_15">[15]</a></span> By some they were denominated Bulgarians,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">{64}</a></span>
and by others Paulicians, and, by a corruption of that
word, Publicans, because it appears that a multitude of
that ancient sect had emigrated hither, and amalgamated
with them.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_16" id="Ref_16" href="#Foot_16">[16]</a></span> Sometimes they were named from the city
or country in which they prevailed, as Toulousians, Lombardists,
and Albigenses. Nevertheless all these branches
were distinguished as keeping the commandments of God,
and the faith of Jesus.</p>

<p>In more recent times they were particularly distinguished
in France by the name of Albigenses, from the
great numbers of them that inhabited the city of Alby, in
the district of Albigeons, between the Garonne, and the
Rhone. After the Council of Alby, which condemned
them as heretics, that name became general and confirmed.
In the records of this Council the following passage occurs:
"They savour of Judaism, they practise circumcision,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_17" id="Ref_17" href="#Foot_17">[17]</a></span>
they observe the Jewish sabbath, but say the holy Dominical
day is no better than other days; let them be accursed."</p>

<p>Very laboured disquisitions have been written, and great
pains taken, by a certain class of writers, to prove that the
Albigenses and Waldenses were very different classes of
Christians, and that they held different opinions and religious
principles. How far this distinction extended it is
impossible at present to ascertain; but when the popes
issued their fulminations against the Albigenses, they expressly
condemned them as Waldenses; by the legates of
the Holy See they were accused of professing the faith of
the Waldenses, the inquisitors formed their processes of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">{65}</a></span>
indictments against them as Waldenses; the leaders of the
crusades made war upon them as Waldenses; they were
persecuted on all sides as such; nor did they attempt to
rebut the charges made against them, but readily adopted
the title thus imposed upon them, which they considered it
an honour to bear.</p>

<p>The Pasaginians, or Passignes, were another branch of
this same sect, who derived their appellation from the
country of Passau, where it is computed that eighty or
one hundred thousand of them resided. That these were
all one people is evident from the fact that the provincial
councils of Toulouse in 1119, and of Lombez in 1176, and
the general councils of Lateran, in 1139 and 1176, do not
particularize them as Pasaginians, or Albigenses, but as
heretics, which shows that they existed and were generally
known before these names were imposed upon them.</p>

<p>Their enemies confirm their identity as well as their
great antiquity. Father Gretzer, a Jesuit, who had examined
the subject fully, and who had every opportunity of
knowing, admits the great antiquity of the heretics, and,
moreover, expresses his firm belief that the Toulousians,
Albigenses, Pasaginians, Arnoldists, Josephists, and the
other heretical factions, who, at that time, were engaging
the attention of the popes, were no other than Waldenses.
This opinion he corroborates by showing wherein they
resembled each other. Among other points he mentions
the following: "Moreover, all these heretics despise the
fasts and feasts of the church, such as Candlemas, Easter,
the Dominical day; in short, all approved ecclesiastical
customs for which they do not find a warrant in the
Scripture. They say, also, that God enjoined rest and
holy meditation upon the seventh day, and that they cannot
feel justified in the observance of any other."</p>

<p>In the decree of Pope Lucius III., dated 1181, we find
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">{66}</a></span>
the Catharists, Paterines, Josephists, Arnoldists, Passignes,
and those calling themselves the "Poor of Lyons,"
all considered as one, and laid under a perpetual anathema.</p>

<p>It is evident from all these testimonies that the Waldenses,
as they penetrated into different countries, became
distinguished by a great variety of appellations, which
they derived from the countries they inhabited, or from
the men who became their leaders at particular periods.
Thus in Albi, Toulouse, Provence, Languedoc, and the
neighbouring countries in France, they were called Albigenses;
Vaudois, Vallenses, and Waldenses in Savoy;
Pasaginians in Passau, and the adjacent regions, with
other names and titles too numerous to mention here.</p>

<p>Nevertheless it appears that some distinction existed
between these different parties. The old Waldenses were
not seceders from the Church of Rome; for neither themselves
nor their ancestors had ever embraced its faith.
Claudius Seyssel, a popish archbishop, declares that the
Waldensian heresy originated from one Leo, who, in the
days of Constantine the Great, led a party of heretics
from Rome into the valleys. Pope Gregory VII. observes
that it is well known that in the days of Constantine the
Great, some assemblies of Jewish Christians being persecuted
at Rome, because they persisted in obedience to the
law of Moses, wandered off into the valleys, where their
descendants remain unto this day. Reiner Sacco declares
that, in the opinion of many authors of note, their antiquity
could be traced to the apostolic age. He also observes
that never, within the memory of man, have they
acknowledged allegiance to the papal see. But that there
were seceding parties, who, at different times and under
particular leaders, withdrew from the communion of that
church, and became amalgamated with the old Waldenses,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">{67}</a></span>
we have every reason to believe. That these latter, though
disposed to condemn many of the grosser superstitions of
that church, such as the worship of images, transubstantiation,
the sacrament of the mass, etc., might still hesitate
about rejecting all her man-made ordinances, is highly probable.
Indeed, this very thing is mentioned by a very
ancient writer, quoted by Perrin, as producing divisions
among them.</p>

<p>At the head of one of these parties was Claude, Bishop of
Turin, who flourished in the commencement of the seventh
century. It does not appear that this bold reformer ever
separated wholly from the Church of Rome, but he denounced
many of her corruptions and abominations in no
measured terms, and had many followers. From the death
of this eminent man until the time of Peter Waldo, of
Lyons, the history of this people is involved in much
obscurity. If they possessed any writers among themselves
capable of giving their transactions to posterity, or
if any records of their ecclesiastical affairs were committed
to writing, the barbarous zeal of their opponents has prevented
their transmission to our times. To the accounts
of their adversaries, therefore, we must look for proofs of
their existence, and here they are abundant. They are,
also, uniformly represented as separated in faith and practice
from the Catholic Church, and as continually multiplying
in number; but further than this we have of them
very imperfect statements.</p>

<p>During all this period the popes appear to have been too
intent upon their own pleasures, and too much engaged
by their own quarrels, to interfere with the despised Waldenses,
and it was not until the twelfth century, that these
people appear in history as obnoxious to the court of Rome.
About this time one Peter Waldo, an opulent merchant of
Lyons, in France, made an attack upon the superstitions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">{68}</a></span>
of the Romish church, particularly the monstrous doctrine
of transubstantiation. He commenced by causing a translation
of the four gospels to be made into French, which he
circulated extensively among his countrymen, particularly
those of the poorer class. He soon became a preacher,
gathered a large church in his native city, from which, a
few years after, himself and his adherents were driven by
the anathemas of the Pope. Waldo, with his numerous
followers, retired into Dauphiny, where his preaching was
attended with abundant success. His principles were
embraced by multitudes, who were denominated Leonists,
Vaudois, Waldenses, etc.; for the very same class of
Christians were designated by all these different appellations
at different times, and according to the different
countries in which they appeared.</p>

<p>Driven from Dauphiny, Waldo sought refuge in Picardy,
where, also, his labours were abundantly blessed. Persecuted
thence, he fled into Germany, and carried with him
the glad tidings of salvation. From Germany he removed
to Bohemia, where he finally finished his course in the year
1179, and the twentieth of his ministry. The amazing
success which had crowned the efforts of this holy man,
aroused the pontiff and his legates to the most vindictive
and sanguinary measures. Terrible persecutions ensued;
the bishops of Mentz and Strasburg breathed nothing but
vengeance and slaughter against them. Thirty-five citizens
of Mentz were burned in one fire at the city of Bingen,
and eighteen in Mentz itself. In Strasburg eighty were
committed to the flames. In other places multitudes died
praising God, and in the blessed hope of a glorious resurrection.</p>

 <h3 class="nobreak">SECTION II.<br />
 <small>CONCERNING THE DOCTRINAL SENTIMENTS AND RELIGIOUS PRACTICES
 OF THE WALDENSES—THEIR SABBATARIAN CHARACTER
 STILL FURTHER CONSIDERED.</small></h3>

</div>

<p>In giving an account of the doctrinal sentiments and
religious practices of this people, we must principally depend
upon the testimonies of their adversaries of the
Romish church, and their own apologies, reasonings, and
confessions, some of which have been handed down to us
through the records of the Inquisition,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_18" id="Ref_18" href="#Foot_18">[18]</a></span> and by the historians
of that period. Of these, Reineirus Saccho is the
most celebrated. He had been for seventeen years, in the
earlier part of his life, in connexion with the Waldenses,
but apostatized from their profession, and joined the
Catholic church, in which he was raised to the eminence of
chief Inquisitor, and became the bitterest persecutor of his
former friends. He was deputed by the pope to reside
in Lombardy, at that time the headquarters of the Pasaginians,
and about 1250, published a book, in which the
errors of the Waldenses were all summed up under three-and-thirty
distinct heads.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_19" id="Ref_19" href="#Foot_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">{70}</a></span>
To attempt any exposition of all these points would far
exceed my limits, I shall therefore confine myself to what
he says in reference to that particular doctrine by which
they were allied to us. "They hold," says he, "that none
of the ordinances of the church, which have been introduced
since Christ's Ascension,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_20" id="Ref_20" href="#Foot_20">[20]</a></span> ought to be observed, as being
of no value."</p>

<p>"The feasts,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_21" id="Ref_21" href="#Foot_21">[21]</a></span> fasts, orders, blessings, offices of the
church, and the like, they utterly reject."</p>

<p>In the sketch which Reineirus furnishes of the doctrines
of the Waldenses, there is not the slightest allusion to any
erroneous opinions regarding the doctrines and principles
of the gospel; and this silence on his part is a noble testimony
to the soundness of their creed. He had himself
been among them, was a man of talents and learning, and
intimately acquainted with all their doctrinal sentiments;
and, having apostatized from their faith, and become their
bitterest enemy and persecutor, no one will suppose that
he wanted the inclination to bring against them any accusation,
which bore the least similitude to the truth. The
errors of which he accuses them, are such as no Seventh-day
Baptist of the present day would shrink from the charge
of holding, since they all, in one way or other, resolve themselves
into the unfounded claims of the ecclesiastical order,
or the substitution for doctrines of the commandments of
men.</p>

<p>In the twelfth century, a colony of the persecuted Waldenses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">{71}</a></span>
obtained permission to settle at Saltz, on the river
Eger.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_22" id="Ref_22" href="#Foot_22">[22]</a></span>
They are represented as working upon, and despising,
the holydays of the church.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_23" id="Ref_23" href="#Foot_23">[23]</a></span> Another eminent
Bohemian author, in giving an account of the Waldenses
of that country, observes, "Moreover they say that of six
days, one day is as good as another, but as God had
enjoined rest upon the seventh, mankind were bound to its
observance."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_24" id="Ref_24" href="#Foot_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>An inquisitor of the Church of Rome, who declares that
he had exact knowledge of the Waldenses, at whose trials
he had assisted many times, and in different countries,
expressly says "that they contemn all ecclesiastical customs
which they do not read of in the Gospel; such as the
observation of Candlemas, Palm Sunday, the adoration of
the cross on Good Friday, and the reconciliation of penitents.
They despise the feast of Easter, and all the festivals
of Christ and the saints,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_25" id="Ref_25" href="#Foot_25">[25]</a></span> and say that one day is as
good as another, working on holydays when they can do
so without being taken notice of."</p>

<p>The same testimony is borne of them by Eneas Sylvius,
who ascended the pontifical chair with the title of Pope
Pius II. Indeed, of all the multitude of Catholic authors
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">{72}</a></span>
of eminence, who have mentioned this people, every one
bears testimony to this peculiarity in their doctrinal sentiments
and religious practices. At a later period, and
among more modern writers, we have every reason to believe
that this feature of their faith has been purposely
disguised. Nevertheless the candour of some has led
them to make very important concessions upon this point.
Mosheim expressly declares that the Pasaginians observed
the Jewish Sabbath. Bossuet, Bishop of Meaux, says, "I
conceive that the old Waldenses, who rejected all the festivals
of the church, and went back to the original Sabbath,
were much more consistent with themselves, than these
gentlemen, the modern Protestants, who, though they discard
all the others, still retain the Dominical day."</p>

<p>But, lest I weary my readers by a multiplication of testimonies,
I shall add but one more quotation, which contains
a concession that, coming from the quarter and at the time
it does, I consider important. Mr. Benedict, in his History
of the Baptists, says, that during the progress of his historical
inquiries, he has met with many facts, where it
seemed as if the heretics, so called, were unsound on the
doctrine of the Sabbath, as established by law; but, he
goes on, it is not certain that all whom the ancient inquisitors
accused of being Sabbath-breakers, would come under
the head of Sabbatarians.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_26" id="Ref_26" href="#Foot_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>It appears to me morally certain that the Seventh-day
Baptists may trace through the Waldenses, at least that
portion of them who were never united to the Church of
Rome, an uninterrupted succession to the apostolic age.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">{73}</a></span>
Indeed, of all the multitude of writers who have treated
of this people, all, without exception, are unanimous in
declaring that they rejected all the feasts and festivals of
the church, as well as infant baptism, and would not observe
any ordinance which they did not read of in Scripture.
Others, especially the ancient Catholics, accuse
them of Judaism, because, according to their testimony,
they kept the Jewish Sabbath. The Council of Lombez
derided the Good Men of Lyons as Sabbatharians. They
were condemned by the Lateran Council of 1139 for refusing
to observe the festivals of the church,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_27" id="Ref_27" href="#Foot_27">[27]</a></span> and the
same accusation was brought against them in canons,
synods, chronicles, conferences, decrees, sermons, homilies,
bulls, confessions, creeds, liturgies, &amp;c. It is hardly possible
that all this concurrent testimony, published at different
times and in different countries, could have been
fabricated. It is barely possible that such men as Evervinus,
of Steinfield; Peter, Abbot of Clugny; Ecbertus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">{74}</a></span>
Schonangiensis, a very celebrated author in his day;
Ermengendus, a ruler both spiritual and temporal; Alexander
III., in council; Alanus Magnus; Izam, the troubadour,
and an inquisitor; Favin, Mazeray, Reineirus
Saccho, etc., could have been mistaken upon this point.
But we are not to conclude that no persons bearing the
name of Waldenses saw and imitated the practices of the
Catholics, in the observance of the holydays of the church.
That many of them, particularly those branches that
seceded from the Church of Rome, paid a superstitious
veneration to the Dominical day, we are ready to admit.
We have no data for tracing the extent of those persons
who held the truth unsophisticated. A considerable portion
of the writers to whom reference has been made were
Catholics,—men high in office in that church, and justly
distinguished for natural and acquired abilities. As this
class of men placed great reliance upon tradition and custom
for the defence of their forms and ceremonies, and laid no
claim to Scripture testimony or command to sanction the
rites of their church, it is not strange that they should be
open and unreserved in all their details of the facts, and
in the freedom of their comments on ancient affairs, which
go to prove the Sabbatarian character of the heretical
sects. With modern writers, particularly those of English
and German extraction, the case is materially different,
as they belong to a class which repudiates all arguments
from any source but the Scriptures for Sunday-keeping,
and who take unusual pains to date the origin of Sabbatarianism
as late as possible. Indeed, as it appears that
the term Sabbatharians was first bestowed upon this very
ancient and holy people, I must consider it as a most
honourable appellation when applied to our denomination.
I am surprised, that though Presbyterians, Episcopalians,
and every other class of Protestant dissenters, have striven
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">{75}</a></span>
to establish an affinity with the old Waldenses, our own
denomination have remained so inert upon the matter.
Can it be possible that among all our ministers not one
was acquainted with the facts bearing upon this case?</p>

<p>I must confess that it gives me inexpressible pleasure to
think that we have conclusive testimony, that, for so many
centuries, in the midst, too, of Catholic countries, God
had reserved to himself such a goodly number who had
not bowed the knee to Baal, and whose mouths had not
kissed him; for certainly next to idolatry is that sin which
would substitute for doctrines the commandments of men,
and neglect the Sabbath of God's appointment, giving
preference to a man-made institution.</p>

<p>There is something extremely ridiculous in the manner
in which modern writers attempt to explain this feature
in the faith of the ancient Waldenses, and in this particular
they are highly favoured by the popular prejudices of
the day. They bring long quotations from ancient Roman
authors to prove that the Waldenses rejected every ordinance
not commanded in the Scripture, but are very careful
not to inform their readers that in the opinion of the same
authors, Sunday-keeping was one of those ordinances.
"Because they would not observe the festivals of Christ
and the saints," says an author of this stamp, "they were
falsely supposed to neglect the Sabbath also." However,
he suppresses the fact that, whatever title Sunday may bear
in modern phraseology, in the times of which we are
speaking it was neither spoken of nor regarded as the
Sabbath, but as a festival of the church the same as
Easter or Christmas. All authorities are unanimous in
declaring that the Waldenses had been from time immemorial
in the possession of the Holy Scriptures, and that
all, even the children, were deeply read in them. The
French Bible was translated from the original manuscript
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">{76}</a></span>
which the Waldenses had retained, according to the testimony
of the translators, from the times of the Apostles,
and which they handed down, in their native tongue, from
generation to generation. The following quotation may
serve to give some idea of their proficiency in the Scriptures:—</p>

<p>"In the time of a great persecution of the Waldenses of
Merendol and Provence," says Perrin, "a certain monk
was deputed by the Bishop of Cavaillon to hold a conference
with them, that they might be convinced of their
errors, and the effusion of blood prevented. But the monk
returned in confusion, owning that, in his whole life, he
had never known so much of the Scriptures as he had
learned during the few days that he had been conversing
with the heretics. The Bishop, however, sent among them
a number of doctors, young men who had lately come from
the Sorbonne, which, at that time, was the very centre of
theological subtlety at Paris. One of these publicly owned
that he understood more of the doctrine of salvation from
the answers of little children in their catechisms, than by
all the disputations he had ever heard before." A Dominican
inquisitor declared that for the first time in his life
he heard the ten commandments of the Decalogue from
the mouth of a Waldensian heretic.</p>

<p>That the deportment and daily walk of the Waldenses
was conformable with their religious profession and scriptural
knowledge, we have every reason to believe. Reinerus
Saccho declares that they live righteously before
men, believing rightly concerning God in every particular,
and holding all the articles contained in the Apostle's
Creed. "The first lesson," says he, "that the Waldenses
teach those whom they bring over to their party, is to
instruct them what kind of persons the disciples of Christ
ought to be, and this they do by the doctrine of the evangelists
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">{77}</a></span>
and apostles, saying that those only are the followers
of the apostles who imitate their manner of life."</p>

<p>An ancient inquisitor gives of them the following account:—</p>

<p>"These heretics are known by their manners and conversation,
for they are orderly and modest in their behaviour
and deportment. They avoid all appearance of pride
in their dress; they neither indulge in finery of attire, nor
are they remarkable for being mean and ragged. They
avoid commerce, that they may be free from falsehood and
deceit. They get their livelihood by manual industry, as
day labourers or mechanics, and their teachers are weavers
or tailors. They are not anxious about amassing riches,
but content themselves with the necessaries of life. They
are chaste, temperate, and sober. They abstain from
anger. Even when they work they either learn or teach.
In like manner, also, their women are modest, avoiding
backbiting, foolish jesting, and levity of speech, especially
abstaining from lies or swearing."</p>

<p>It may be interesting to notice in this connexion some
of the peculiarities of their religious practices.</p>

<p>They constantly appealed to the Scriptures both of the
Old and New Testament, as their only guide and rule of
faith and practice as to religious duties. They are perpetually
accused by Catholic writers of rejecting all human
institutions, traditions, and inventions, and both friends
and foes are unanimous in confessing that there was
scarcely a person among them, either man, or woman, or
child, that was not better acquainted with Holy Writ than
the doctors of the church. They were likewise accused of
being without priests. This must be understood as applying
to the absence among them of a certain class of men
paid or pensioned by yearly salaries for discharging the
ministrations of the gospel. An old historian who was intimately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">{78}</a></span>
acquainted with their affairs, observes, "That
they severely denounce the whole body of the clergy on
account of their idle course of life, and say that they ought
to labour with their hands, as did the Apostles."</p>

<p>Another says—"Their preachers are weavers and mechanics,
who get their own living, and are not chargeable
upon their hearers." The same author goes on to say that
even their missionaries were accustomed to travel from
place to place in the character of travelling merchants;
and this, he assures us, subserved to good purposes; first,
they were enabled to support themselves; and second, they
gained thereby readier access to persons of rank and
fortune.</p>

<p>Their treatment of females in their religious assemblies
was liberal and courteous in the extreme. They were not
only allowed to preach, but bore an equal part with the
men in all the business of the church; and the deeper we
go into antiquity the more evident does this appear.</p>

<p>Against war, capital punishment, and oaths, they were
decided in expressing their disapprobation. Their opposition
to bearing arms, and to war in all its operations,
was unanimous and unequivocal. Whoever commanded
them to the field they refused to obey, alleging that they
could not conscientiously comply. No contingencies would
induce them to assume the weapons of death; and this
peculiarity was well understood by all the world, and made
the onsets of the inquisitors and crusaders upon these weaponless
Christians the more cruel and contemptible. Concerning
oaths, they appear to have adopted the language
of our Saviour in a literal sense, where he commands his
disciples, "Swear not at all."</p>

<p>Such were their rules. Whatever deviations there might
have been were exceptions. Such deviations, it is natural
to suppose, frequently occurred; but they generally came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">{79}</a></span>
from those portions of the community who had been educated
in the faith of Rome.</p>

<p>As it relates to their Baptist character I shall produce
but one quotation, although a multitude might be given.</p>

<p>"As the Catholics of these times baptized by immersion,
the Paterines, by what name soever they were called, as
Manicheans, Gazara, Josephites, Pasaginians, &amp;c., made
no complaint of the mode of baptizing; but when they
were examined upon the subject, they objected vehemently
against the baptism of infants, and condemned it as an
error."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_28" id="Ref_28" href="#Foot_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>Of their doctrinal sentiments we can know but little, as
no other portion of their history is involved in so much
obscurity. Reinerus Saccho, however, represents them as
believing rightly in everything pertaining to God and the
Apostles' Creed. And they must have been evangelical
Christians; for, when we see religious societies, century
after century, holding on to their principles, and persisting
in their religious practices, amidst the severest persecutions
that were ever experienced, there is irrefragable evidence
that they were built on a firm foundation. Indeed, it is
hardly probable that among people whose religious teachers
were obliged to depend upon manual labour for a livelihood,
there would be much time wasted in unprofitable
discussions about abstract points of theology.</p>

<p>The locality of these Christians, before they were dispersed
by persecution, was in the principality of Piedmont,
which derives its name from the singularity of its situation
at the foot of the Alps,—a prodigious range of mountains
that form a natural boundary between Italy, France,
Switzerland, and Germany. It is bounded on the north
by Savoy, on the east by the duchies of Milan and Montferrat,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">{80}</a></span>
on the south by the county of Nice, and on the
west by France. In ancient times it formed a part of
Lombardy, but recently it has become an appanage of the
Sardinian monarch, whose capital is Turin, one of the
finest cities of Europe. It comprises an extensive tract of
rich and fruitful valleys, embosomed in mountains, which
are again encircled in mountains, intersected with deep
and rapid rivers, and exhibiting, in strong contrast, the
utmost beauty and luxuriance with the most frightful
spectacles of barrenness and desolation. The country is
an interchange of hill and vale, mountain and plain, through
which four principal rivers wind their way to the Mediterranean.
Besides these, there are eight-and-twenty smaller
streams, which, winding their courses in different directions,
contribute to the beauty and fertility of these Eden-like valleys.</p>

<p>The Pyrenees are another huge mountain range, that
separate France from Spain, and extend from the Mediterranean
Sea to the Atlantic Ocean, a distance of at least
two hundred miles by a breadth of one hundred. This
surface, like the former, is wonderfully diversified with
hills and dales, mountains and valleys, in which places,
and all along the borders of Spain, throughout the south
of France, among and below the Alps, along the Rhine,
and even to Bohemia and Passau, thousands of Christians
were found, even in the darkest times, who preserved the
faith in its purity, rejected the traditions of men, took the
Scripture for their guide and rule of conduct, and were
persecuted only for righteousness' sake. This place, in
the desert, mountainous country, almost inaccessible and
unknown to the rest of the world, was probably the place
especially meant in Revelation, as prepared of God for
the woman, where she should be fed and nourished during
the reign of Antichrist.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">{81}</a></span>
These people were deeply imbued with the spirit of
missions; but in this, as everything else, they closely
adhered to apostolic example. They had none of the
cumbrous machinery of modern times in their arrangements
for disseminating the light of the gospel. They knew
nothing of supporting in worldly state expensive teachers
in foreign countries, or of building costly chapels for them
to preach in. But, in the simple style of itinerating merchants
or peddlers, their missionaries travelled from country
to country, carrying with them a few pages of the Scriptures
in manuscript, holding little meetings, ordaining
deacons, and sustaining the hopes and faith of the persecuted
and tempted ones.</p>

<p>Of their modes of worship we know but little. Their
churches, however, were divided into compartments, such
as in modern times are called associations; and these were
again subdivided into congregations. They generally assembled
for worship in private houses or in the shade of
groves. Their churches contained from two to fifteen
hundred members. In times of persecution they met in
small companies of six, ten, fifteen, or twenty, but never
in large assemblies. Besides these churches established
in their mountain fastnesses, the Waldenses, or Passagines,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_29" id="Ref_29" href="#Foot_29">[29]</a></span>
had instituted churches in nearly all the principal cities in
the south of France and the northern parts of Italy. At
Modena their place of meeting was in a large manufactory,
which was owned and worked by the brethren. In Milan
they occupied almost an entire street, and their church is
said to have contained nearly two thousand communicants.
In 1056, their church in Avignon contained six hundred
members, and a remnant continued, notwithstanding various
reverses of fortune, so late as 1698. We are also informed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">{82}</a></span>
that there were churches of the same order at Brescia,
Ferrara, Verona, Rimini, Romandiola, and many other
places. For many centuries they remained untroubled by
the state; but the clergy preached and published books
against them. In the eleventh and twelfth century they
comprised the bulk of the inhabitants of Lombardy, and
several men eminent for rank, station, and talents, belonged
to their communion. It is to these that M. de la Roque
refers when he says, "We have had many worthy and
pious men, well instructed in science and the history of
the Fathers, who were neither ashamed nor afraid to adopt
both the practice and defence of the observation of the
seventh day against their opponents; and, contrary to
popular custom, withstood every allurement and temptation
that the enlightened and persecuting ages could afford.
The observation of the Sabbath remained not with them a
matter of doubtful disputation, as that of the first day did
with the Rev. Dr. Watts, and many others who were engaged
in the controversy upon that subject." A modern
French writer, in treating the history of the Gallican
church, observes that it is well known that all Lombardy,
the south of France, and even the mountainous district in
the north of Spain, were infested by a class of heretics,
who not only derided all the festivals of the church, but
kept the Jewish Sabbath; "and I have heard," he continues,
"that the primitive Waldenses were guilty of the
same practices."</p>

<p>From these plain facts, and a multitude of others that
might be recorded, we may conclude that a large proportion
of these ancient people were Sabbatarians,—were
Seventh-day Baptists. In tracing their peculiarities, I
have been forcibly reminded of our own denominational
traits, especially at a former period.</p>

<p>There is no doubt but that they continued for ages, preserving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">{83}</a></span>
a sameness of views, and keeping the commandments
of God and the faith of Jesus. When their congregations
became too numerous, they separated, and formed
new assemblies. They continually refused to observe any
religious ordinances for which they found no warrant in
the Scriptures. They refused baptism to children, only
admitting to that ordinance those persons of whose repentance
and spiritual regeneration no doubts were entertained.
They maintained church discipline upon all, even their
ministers. And though cast down, they were not disheartened;
though persecuted, they were not extirpated, until
the days for their prophesying<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_30" id="Ref_30" href="#Foot_30">[30]</a></span> were accomplished, until
they had borne witness for the truth during the time appointed,
when it pleased the great Head of the Church to
permit their enemies to consummate their everlasting glory,
by bestowing upon them the crown of martyrdom, and,
from being the church militant, they were removed, almost
in a body, to join the church triumphant.</p>

<p>Of their Sabbatarian character there is not the least
room for doubt. Indeed, whatever novelty may be connected
with this idea, I believe that every one, upon mature
consideration, will perceive its consistency. They were
planted in the valleys—if not in the apostolic age—before
the antichristian power had obtained the dominance at
Rome. Robinson asserts that there were many churches
of Jewish Christians in the imperial city during the fourth
century, which well accords with the declaration of Pope
Gregory VII., that the Waldensian heresy originated from
a company of Jewish heretics, who removed from Rome
thither in the time of Constantine the Great; while a multitude
of authorities, both friends and foes, are unanimous
in declaring that they were never subjected to Rome, but
persisted to the end in the abhorrence of all her feasts and
festivals.</p>

 <h3 class="nobreak">SECTION III.<br />
 <small>CONCERNING THEIR PERSECUTIONS, DISPERSION, AND EXTIRPATION—MORE
 ACCOUNTS OF THEIR SABBATARIAN CHARACTER.</small></h3>

</div>

<p>It was not until the twelfth century that the Waldenses,
and other heretical parties, appear in history as a
people exposed to the persecuting edicts of Rome. And
even then it seems to have been occasioned, in a great
measure, by the great success that crowned the labours of
Peter Waldo, whose followers first obtained the name of
Leonists, or Poor Men of Lyons; and who, when persecuted,
fled to the mountains, and became incorporated
with the other inhabitants of the valleys. By this means,
the Waldenses were brought into collision with the power
of Rome, who, arming against them the civil authorities,
proceeded to consummate their destruction and extirpation.
At this time it appears, that under the protection
and through the connivance of the Counts of Toulouse,
the Viscount of Beziers, and many others of the French
nobility, a score of the principal cities in Languedoc, Provence,
and Dauphiny, were filled with the different heretical
parties. But the civil power, and even the more
summary efforts of the Inquisition, appear to have been
too slow in their operations to meet the wishes of papal
vengeance, although persecuted under the agency of Dominic,
the chief inquisitor. The Pope was dissatisfied—new
schemes were projected, apparently more mild and
conciliatory, but under this pleasing exterior was concealed
the most abominable treachery. The papal legates
proposed holding a public debate, in which the points at
issue between the parties should be decided by amicable
arbitration. To this reasonable offer the unsuspecting
brethren readily consented. The place of conference
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">{85}</a></span>
agreed upon was Montreal, near Carcassone. Two umpires
were appointed from each side; those of the Catholics were
the Bishops of Villeneuse and Auxerre, and those of the
opposite party, R. de Bot and Anthony Riviere. On the
part of the Albigenses, a number of the pastors were
appointed to manage the debate, of whom the principal
was Arnold Hot. He first arrived at the appointed place,
accompanied by a number of his friends. He was met on
behalf of the papacy, by a bishop named Eusas, the renowned
Dominic, two legates of the Pope, and several others
of the Catholic clergy. According to Catholic historians,
who are very concise and remarkably unanimous in their accounts
of this celebrated conference, the points which Arnold
undertook to prove were, that the sacrament of the mass
was idolatry, that the baptism of infants was unscriptural,
that the festivals of the church were heathen appointments,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_31" id="Ref_31" href="#Foot_31">[31]</a></span>
and, finally, that the Pope was Antichrist, and the Church
of Rome the harlot mentioned in Revelations. In maintenance
of these points, Arnold drew up certain propositions,
which he transmitted to the bishop, who required
two weeks to answer them, which was granted. At the
appointed time the bishop appeared, and read his reply in
the public assembly. Arnold requested permission to make
a verbal answer, only entreating their patient hearing if he
took a considerable time in answering so prolix a writing.
He was answered with fair speeches and many promises of
a patient hearing. He then discoursed upon the subject
for four days, with such perspicuity, fluency and precision,
such order and forcible reasoning, that a powerful impression
was made upon the minds of the audience. He
finally called upon the Catholics for their defence, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">{86}</a></span>
the Bishop of Villeneuse declared that the conference must
be broken up, because the army of the crusaders was
approaching, and near at hand.</p>

<p>What he asserted was true. The papal armies advanced,
and all points of controversy were instantly decided by
fire and fagot. It is estimated that not less than two
hundred thousand of these innocent people perished in the
short space of two months. The war of extermination continued
twenty years, and one million persons were put to
death. These disastrous scenes occurred in the commencement
of the twelfth century, and three hundred years previous
to the dawn of the Reformation in Germany. During
this long period, the circumstances of the Waldenses were
always afflictive, but at some times and in some countries
more so than in others. The Church of Rome, with the
armies of crusaders who were always at hand, and always
ready to lend their assistance for the extirpation of
heresy, and the monks of the Inquisition, who were never
more numerous and active, seemed determined to exterminate
them from the face of the earth. But the contests of
the Catholic states among themselves, the quarrels of the
popes with the secular princes, whose affairs they attempted
to control, combined with other causes, afforded these
victims of ecclesiastical tyranny some short and temporary
seasons of repose.</p>

<p>Of the multitudes who perished beneath the iron power of
the Inquisition, we have little account. Nevertheless some
details of cases of individual suffering have been given to
the world, and multitudes of others lie concealed among
the manuscripts preserved in ancient libraries. From
records of this kind, Philip de Mornay, a French author of
some distinction, composed a work purporting to be the
memoirs of celebrated Waldensian martyrs, in which detailed
and circumstantial narratives of many trials were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">{87}</a></span>
given, together with the interrogatories and answers of the
criminals, and the heresies of which they were accused.
According to these statements they were perpetually
accused of Judaism, of practising circumcision, and observing
the Jewish Sabbath. The former charges they
repelled with disdain. Of the latter, they generally replied
that God had commanded the observance of the seventh
day, which command was binding upon Christians, as much
as Jews, since neither Christ nor his Apostles had ever
commanded its abrogation.</p>

<p>Some of these accounts are very interesting, and the
Sabbatarians reasoned in precisely the same manner as we
do now.</p>

<p>On the 14th of September, 1492, about thirty persons
were committed to the inquisitorial dungeons of Toulouse,
upon a charge of Judaism, which, as every one knows,
was considered a mortal sin in Catholic countries. Of
these, the most eminent was Anthony Ferrar, who had
been a pastor or teacher in the Sabbatarian church of that
city. After remaining in prison ten days, he received a
visit from an Italian monk named Gregory, to whom his
examination had been committed. He was accompanied by
two other monks, who were to act as witnesses. After a
long conference touching his age, property, manner of
living, associates, relations, and similar subjects, Gregory
at last came to the matter in question.</p>

<p><i>Greg.</i>—But, Anthony, you must be a liar and a deceiver,
for I have been credibly informed that yourself, and all
your friends, were of the cursed race of Israel.</p>

<p><i>An.</i>—It is false, we were all honest Frenchmen, and
Christians, followers of Jesus.</p>

<p><i>Greg.</i>—Nay! but you were Jews, for instead of baptizing
your infant children, you have all the males circumcised.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">{88}</a></span></p>

<p><i>An.</i>—You do very wrong to accuse us of that practice;
for it is something of which we are entirely innocent.</p>

<p><i>Greg.</i>—Hey! do you then baptize your children?</p>

<p><i>An.</i>—We do not, neither do we circumcise them.</p>

<p><i>Greg.</i>—Nevertheless, you must be Jews, since you say
that the law of Moses is still binding.</p>

<p><i>An.</i>—We say that the ten commandments are still
binding.</p>

<p><i>Greg.</i>—Yes, and instead of observing the festivals of the
Holy Church, and honouring the holy day of the Lord, on
which he arose from the dead, you were accustomed to
meet for worship upon the old Sabbath, or Saturday.</p>

<p><i>An.</i>—We did, indeed, rest and attend to divine worship
upon the seventh day, even as God commanded.</p>

<p>My limits will not permit me to transcribe the remainder
of this interesting conversation. Anthony, with his associates
in misfortune, were subsequently burned in the marketplace
in Toulouse, and all died praising God that they
were worthy to suffer for his name. Hundreds of others,
of whom the names of Jean de Borgen, Matthew Hainer,
Auguste Riviere, Philippe Nicola, and Henri Maison,
have been preserved, were accused of and confessed to the
same.</p>

<p>"Of the many who were burned, and otherwise destroyed
for Judaism," observes a Spanish author of the sixteenth
century, "it is not probable that one-tenth were of the
race of Israel, but heretics, who, for persisting in saying
that the law of Moses was still binding, were accused of
Jewish practices, such as circumcision and sabbatizing, to
the latter of which they uniformly plead guilty."</p>

<p>A Dominican inquisitor, in giving an account of the
proceedings of that infernal tribunal in the north of Spain,
declares that since it was known that many of the heretics
were accustomed to solemnize the old Sabbath by religious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">{89}</a></span>
worship, and an absolute inattention to secular employments,
it became the policy of the Holy Office to take notice of such
shops as were shut up on that day, and of such persons as
were found to be absent from worldly engagements. "The
result answered my expectations," he continues, "for when
these people were arrested, and being brought before me,
were shown the rack, they generally confessed their Judaical
practices, at least so far as it related to sabbatizing, which
the holy church had expressly forbidden."</p>

<p>Other testimonies of this same character might be produced,
but enough has been said to prove to our own denomination,
and to the world, that at the time when the
crusading armies made their frightful onsets upon the
heretical churches of Piedmont, the South of France, and
Catalonia, there were large communities of Sabbath-keeping
Christians in all these parts. But historians are
unanimous in confessing that they were drowned in blood,
and driven into exile. Their race disappeared, and their
opinions ceased to influence society. In hundreds of
villages, all the inhabitants were massacred with a blind
fury. Year after year new armies continued to arrive,
more numerous than were employed in other wars. It is
impossible to ascertain how many were destroyed by these
dreadful crusades, but it is certain that the visible churches
of these Christians were extirpated by fire and sword;
though a bleeding remnant escaped by flight, concealment,
and Catholic conformity. Of the details of their sufferings
and miseries it is impossible to give in this place even an
abridged account. For many consecutive years they suffered
every species of cruelty, barbarity, and persecution,
which the crusades and the Inquisition could inflict. Those
who remained were indiscriminately slaughtered, and of
those who fled, multitudes miserably perished by the way.
Their total extirpation was effected in 1686, at which time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">{90}</a></span>
the ancient Waldensian and Albigensian churches ceased
to exist. It is true, that in 1689, three years after the
expulsion of the whole fraternity, a company, sword in
hand, fought their way back to the valleys of Piedmont, of
which they took possession, and in which their descendants
still reside. This company, under the command of one
Amand, committed the most frightful acts of wickedness
and barbarity, and exhibited in all their conduct a spirit
entirely different from the ancient Waldenses. Their leader
acted in the double capacity of spiritual pastor and military
chieftain, and the creeds and formulas which he instituted,
and which are still observed among them, are comparatively
of modern date.</p>

<p>In closing these very brief and imperfect accounts
of these ancient witnesses for the truth, a few remarks
may not be inappropriate, more especially as I have made
a claim regarding their denominational character, that has
never, to my knowledge, been advanced by our friends,
and which will not be readily conceded by our opponents.</p>

<p>If we take the Waldenses under the great variety of
names which they bore at different periods and in different
locations, it appears that they were by far the most important
branch of dissenters from the Church of Rome, and
that they were divided among themselves like the present
dissenters in England. The more I have investigated this
matter, the more evident it appears; and as it would be
unwise for us to attempt to establish an affinity with all of
them in the distinctive feature of our order, it is certain
that our claims at least to a due proportion can never be
disproved. That many of them observed the seventh day,
and that some of them paid a superstitious veneration to
the first day, is quite as certain as the fact that they were
all persecuted by the Church of Rome. The farther we go
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">{91}</a></span>
back into antiquity, the more distinctly does their Sabbatarian
character appear. Nothing but the blindness of
bigotry can induce any man, or class of men, who have
paid the smallest attention to the accounts of all the
Catholic authors concerning them, to deny that complaints
against them for disregarding the festivals of the church,
in which they included the Dominical day, were widespread
and long-continued; and that almost equally with
the former were the accusations of their paying an undue
regard to Saturday, or the Jewish Sabbath. On the other
hand, it is clear, from the terms "some of them," and "a
part," with similar expressions employed by the writers in
question, that they did not accuse all of having fallen into
this monstrous heresy. The keeping of the first day
appears to be the last thing that is given up by those who
withdraw from the old, corrupt establishments; and nothing
affords a clearer evidence of the prejudices of education
than the slow reluctance with which it is yielded, as
they find that the proofs for its support from the Scriptures
fail them, and the moral and immutable character of the
ancient Sabbath comes up to their view in its practical
operations. Such has been the case in all places where
we have certain knowledge, and the probability is that it
was so in the dark ages beyond our sight.</p>

<p>It is not for us to claim the whole body of dissenters of
the better class; but we may claim, and I believe that
candid men of all parties will concede, upon a thorough
examination of the ancient Catholic authors, that Sabbatarian
sentiments have prevailed much more extensively
among these ancient sects than has generally been supposed.
Neither my time nor my limits would allow a full
investigation of this very interesting subject. The most
that I could hope to do was to make a beginning. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">{92}</a></span>
field for research is very wide, and upon the Sabbatarian
question it is wholly unoccupied. And here I would remark,
for the information of those who may feel disposed
to examine the subject hereafter, that it is only by an
immediate reference to the old Catholic writers that we
can ever hope to obtain much information upon this point.
These speak with great plainness, and without paraphrase,
omission, or concealment, of the rejecters of the church-festivals,
and the observers of the Jewish Sabbath. They
were open and undisguised, and were far from exhibiting
the cautiousness of the moderns upon this subject. They
had no concern about the proofs for the observance of the
first day, and no fear of publishing to the world how many
of the incorrigible heretics refused to venerate it. It made
no difference to them if it was not found in the Bible,
since it was in the decrees of the councils and the bulls of
the popes, which, with them, were of equal authority with
the Scripture command.</p>

<p>For a long time their complaints ran high on this head
against many of the seceding parties; and it is well for us
that this testimony is placed beyond the reach of modern
writers, where it cannot be garbled, mutilated, and suppressed.
It is not to be expected that our first-day brethren,
even those of the Baptist persuasion, would take any
pains to prove that these apostolic communities were Sabbatarian,
though possessing the knowledge that such was
the fact. It has been their policy to represent us as insignificant
in number and recent in origin. Unfortunately,
we have contributed to extend that delusion. For my own
part, I am of the opinion that in the dark ages there were
many more of our denomination than there are at present.
Not that any in these ages were called Seventh-day Baptists;
no such thing: but that multitudes, like ourselves,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">{93}</a></span>
refused to observe the festivals of the church, contended
that the Decalogue was moral and immutable, and refused
baptism to any but professing believers. Like ourselves,
they took the Scriptures for their guide and rule of faith
in everything, and were most decided in rejecting everything
for which they found no warrant in that holy book,
despising all human appointments, all priestly traditions,
and man-made institutions. For many ages the valleys
formed an asylum, to which all seceding parties from the
Romish hierarchy fled for protection. It is not strange—indeed,
we might expect—that this amalgamation with new
parties would beget new customs, which in the end might
entirely change their denominational character. This was
certainly the case as it respects the discipline and government
of their churches, which for a number of the first centuries
partook of all the ease and freedom characteristic of
modern Baptist communities, then was modelled by degrees
into a Presbyterian form, and finally ended in something
of the Episcopalian character. Such denominational
changes are neither new nor strange, especially when we
consider the severity of penal statutes on the one hand,
and the spirit of conformity, lukewarmness, and indifference
on the other, which continually operate to prepare
dissenters for an approximation to the established church,
and, finally, for a union with it.</p>

<p>At the time of the Reformation these old communities
were in circumstances of peculiar trials and distress. New
persecutions of unusual severity had been stirred up against
them by the Catholics, whose resentment had been exasperated
in the keenest manner, in consequence of the new
and unexpected attacks that had been made upon the
authority of the church by the Protestant reformers, and
who were thereby led to vent their spite upon all whom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">{94}</a></span>
they found without their pale, whatever might be their
innocence, or however quiet and inoffensive they might
have been. Thus harassed and distressed, these afflicted
people were ready to submit to almost any terms, for the
sake of gaining new friends and protectors; and one company
after another of those who had been driven into
exile, and were settled in Bohemia, Germany, and the
Netherlands, became associated, as an incipient measure,
and in the end were amalgamated with, the Reformed or
Presbyterian party, under the direction of Calvin and
Zuinglius. Of the fact of this union of the Waldenses
with the Reformers there can be no dispute; but the process
of this confederacy, and the terms upon which it was
consummated, have never been satisfactorily decided. It
is morally certain, however, that the subject of the Sabbath
was discussed by some of these parties, since we are
informed by various historical documents that Calvin objected
to the seventh day, but conceded that the old
Fathers had substituted the first day in its place, and
proposed, as an instance of Christian liberty, to reject
both, and make a Sabbath of the fifth day of the week.
This overture, we are informed, was indignantly rejected;
but there is reason to believe that the observance of the
first day, together with infant baptism, were among the
changes in their denominational character which were
brought about by their union with the German reformers.
In 1530, a Waldensian community, located in Provence,
sent two of their ministers, George Morrel and Peter
Masson, as deputies to the Swiss reformers, which resulted
in their union with the new party. These deputies, after
their return, declared to their brethren how many and
great errors their old ministers had kept them in, and how
their new allies had happily set them right. Subsequently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">{95}</a></span>
a part of them, at least, became one with the Huguenots
of France, and the Protestants of Germany.</p>

<p>But, so late as 1823, an English clergyman, named
Gilly, visited the Vaudois in the valley of Perosa, making
his journey thither by Turin, and had an interview with
Mr. Peyrani, who was then seventy years old, and is since
dead. He was the successor of a line of pastors whom
tradition would extend to the Apostles themselves. In his
possession was a library amply supplied with books, and
parchments, and paper manuscripts, accumulated by his
ancestors. According to his accounts, "in the summer,
when these pastoral people are tending their cattle at a
distance from the valleys, and occupying their chalets, or
temporary cabins, upon the summits of the mountains, the
clearness of the atmosphere allows the sound of the Sabbath
bells to reach them, calling them to the worship of
the Creator, beneath the canopy of heaven. They assemble
in a convenient place on the green turf, to listen
to the exhortations of their minister, who follows them on
every seventh day to their remotest pasturings." From
this it appears that a portion of them, at least, still observe
the ancient Sabbath.</p>

 <small>SEMI-JUDAISERS—THEIR ORIGIN, HISTORY, ETC.</small></h3>

</div>

<p>We have already seen that the different branches of the
great Waldensian community were known under a variety
of names, which were generally significative of some distinguished
leader among them, the country whence they
came, or something descriptive of their peculiar tenets.</p>

<p>The epithet of Semi-Judaisers, which was applied as a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">{96}</a></span>
term of reproach to a sect which flourished in Transylvania,
Holland, and some parts of Germany, and even
extended itself into Russia and Poland, in the latter part
of the fourteenth and during the commencement of the
fifteenth centuries, is of itself sufficient to show the Sabbatarian
character of the people it was designed to distinguish.
To Judaise, Judaising, and Judaisers, being synonymous
terms of reproach, or rather terms appellative,—the
former to signify the action of sabbatizing, and the
latter to designate the person by whom the Sabbath was
thus observed. Of this we have abundant testimony. The
Council of Laodicea, in 350, passed a decree, in which
Christians are reproved for Judaising. "If any be found
Judaising, let him be anathematized," was the language of
these pretended fathers of the church.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_32" id="Ref_32" href="#Foot_32">[32]</a></span> Athanasius says,
"We assemble on Saturday, not that we are infected with
Judaism;" thus repelling a charge which, in every age and
country, has been affixed as a stigma to Sabbath-keepers.</p>

<p>The first glimpse that I have been able to obtain of this
sect is given by an old German author, whose works were
published at Antwerp, in 1667. In speaking of the religious
parties and factions which agitated the country, he
says: "As to the people called by their enemies the Semi-Judaisers,
it is certain that they originated from a colony
of the persecuted Waldenses, who fled from Lombardy into
Bohemia about 1450, and thence removed into Transylvania,
which subsequently became their headdquarters.
They say that the law of Moses is binding upon Christians,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">{97}</a></span>
and, accordingly, solemnize divine service upon Saturday,
or the old Sabbath."</p>

<p>As to the outward circumstances of this people, they
were generally among the industrious poor,—mechanics
and husbandmen. They were never in squalid wretchedness
or beggarly destitution, when left to enjoy the fruits
of their industry. Many of them, both male and female,
became inmates of the households of the great, in the
capacity of nurses and servants, and were greatly esteemed
on account of their sobriety, intelligence, and faithfulness.
Others settled on the outskirts of the neglected domains of
the nobility, where they soon converted the barren wastes
into productive fields, and reared new and flourishing
settlements, to the great satisfaction of the landlords.</p>

<p>From the very brief and imperfect accounts that I have
been able to obtain concerning them, there does not appear
to have been anything strange or singular in their manner
of worship. They took the Scriptures for their guide,
rejected all Popish ceremonies, inventions, and institutions,
administered baptism by immersion, and contended that
the church of Christ should be inaccessible to unholy and
unregenerate persons. Their ministers were allowed no
salaries, and were not distinguished from the lay brethren
by any superior authority or attainments. All who felt
disposed to do so were permitted to teach, "or prophesy,"
and in this particular they seem to have strongly resembled
the Quakers.</p>

<p>That they possessed a decided missionary spirit is evident
from the fact that their doctrines were secretly and
silently, but very effectually, disseminated throughout
many parts of Europe, where they took deep and lasting
root.</p>

<p>Subsequent to their removal into Bohemia, they became
incorporated with the United Bohemian Brethren, whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">{98}</a></span>
numbers were considerable in every part of the empire.
Scarcely, however, were they reduced to order, when a
terrible persecution was set on foot by the Catholic party,
and they were called upon to prove the strength of their
faith by endurance and perseverance to the end. They
were compelled to forsake their towns and villages in the
depths of winter. The sick were cast into the fields.
Hundreds expired in flames, or on the rack. The public
prisons were filled with suspected persons. Such as effected
their escape retired into the caves and deserts of
the country, where they held religious assemblies, elected
teachers, and decided upon their future course.</p>

<p>About 1500, a large company of the Semi-Judaisers removed
into Transylvania, where they experienced many
vicissitudes until the dawn of the Reformation in Germany.
At this time they had many large and flourishing congregations,
and being generally of the poorer class, and withal
extremely peaceable and inoffensive in their manners, they
were suffered by the princes and nobility of the country to
live upon their estates without molestation. In 1565,
they first appear in history as a people obnoxious to the
rulers of Transylvania; and then it was chiefly in consequence
of the success which had attended the propagation
of their doctrines, and the conversion of Francis Davidis,
superintendent of the Socinian churches in that country,
to their creed. Davidis, to eminent talents and great
learning, united the most ardent zeal and untiring perseverance.
Besides taking advantage of every opportunity
to disseminate his own peculiar views, he boldly attacked
the doctrines of the adverse party, disputing in person
with the Socinian doctors, and contending that the ten
commandments of the Decalogue were of a moral and immutable
nature, and, consequently, that the seventh day of
the week should be observed as a sabbatical rest. His
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">{99}</a></span>
views were highly offensive to Christopher Bathori, prince
of Transylvania, who threw him into prison, where he died
in 1579, at an advanced age. His doctrines, thus brought
into public and general notice, spread rapidly, and were
embraced by several men of eminence. Of these the most
distinguished were Christiern Francken, who disputed in
public for three days with Faustus Socinus, upon the question
of the Sabbath, and John Somers, Master of the
Academy of Clausenberg. The violent contentions that
ensued made a noise in all parts of Germany, and reached
the ears of Luther, who wrote a book upon the subject.
In 1585, Jacob Paleologus, of the isle of Ohio, was burned
at Rome for Judaism. At his trial, he declared that the
ten commandments were moral and immutable in their
nature. In other countries executions of a similar character
took place; and the Semi-Judaisers were persecuted
from region to region, like the vilest of mankind. Many
of them fled into Poland, Lithuania, and Russia, where,
mingling with the other dissenters from the established
churches, they formed congregations, and became quite
numerous. Under the mild reign of Udislaus II., king of
Poland, their numbers greatly increased, and many persons
of wealth and respectability united in their communion.
A Polish writer informs us that their churches were
numerous and flourishing in many parts, but particularly
in the Palatinates of Polotsk, Witepsk, Nuislaw, Mohilev,
and Minsk. At Dorpat, in Livonia, there was a church
containing five hundred members, where, in 1816, a small
remnant still resided. From Poland they extended themselves
into the middle and southern provinces of Russia,
where they remained in a state of general peace until the
year 1638, when a persecution began in Poland, through
the instigation of the Catholics, extended to this country,
and multitudes of dissenters of all ranks and classes were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">{100}</a></span>
barbarously put to death. At this time the Semi-Judaisers
were known in these countries under the name of Sabbaton,
a name sufficiently descriptive of their peculiar and
distinguishing tenets. In consequence of these terrible
persecutions, they retired into the most obscure and unfrequented
districts, and their history is wrapped in a great
degree of obscurity, until the reign of the Empress Catherine II.,
when they are again brought into view as a people
obnoxious to the government. Under her persecuting
edicts, their churches were demolished, their congregations
broken up and scattered, and the more eminent for piety
and learning put to death by a variety of cruel tortures.
But a remnant was saved to perpetuate the truth. Since
that period they have experienced many vicissitudes, but,
upon all and every occasion, they have found their safety
in obscurity. They are distinguished for their ardent love
of the Holy Scriptures, for their opposition to the use of
images or pictures, and for their uniformly pious and consistent
conduct. They have no paid or salaried body of
ecclesiastics. They consider the invocation of saints to be
idolatry, and insist upon the right of private judgment in
the interpretation of Scripture; a circumstance that renders
them highly obnoxious to the Russian priests. They
only admit professing believers to the rite of baptism. In
their sentiments concerning the Trinity they are said to be
Arian.</p>

<p>In 1824, a large community of these Christians were
found by a celebrated French traveller settled on the banks
of the river Moskwa. They numbered several thousand,
and wore the Armenian costume, which people they strongly
resembled in manners and customs. He gives as their
peculiarities that they accounted as no better than fable
whatever was preached without Scripture proof, and affirm
that the traditions of the church are no better than the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">{101}</a></span>
traditions of the Pharisees. They look upon a church
built of stone as no better than any other building; neither
do they believe that God dwells there. They say that to
suppose that God is found in churches, monasteries, and
oratories, any more than in any other place, is limiting
the divine majesty. Their prayers and sermons are extempore.
Their ministers, like themselves, are generally
mechanics or labourers; nor is there any difference of
rank among them. They admit all the sacraments instituted
by Christ, but none others. They regard the ten
commandments as moral and immutable, and, moreover,
are conscientious observers of the old Sabbath, or Saturday.</p>

<p>"I was told," continues the same author, "that these
people were very numerous in many parts of Russia; and
that their missionaries could travel all over the empire,
and pass every night with their brethren. They were
known to each other by a secret sign, and all their houses
are distinguished by a private mark, known only to the
initiated. In consequence of their extreme caution that
none but members of their churches should be present at
their assemblies, they have been accused of many horrid
and abominable practices,—such as drinking the blood of
a child, and the indulgence of licentiousness,—their accusers
not considering that the only security for their
safety is in their avoidance of public notoriety." All
testimonials concur in stating that their numbers are considerable,
but that, through fear of a recurrence of persecution,
they courted obscurity; being content with the
humblest stations, and only seeking to keep the commandments
of God and the faith of Jesus. "Of the sect called
Sabbaton, who reside in Russia," says Voltaire, "some
say one thing and some another. It is evident, however,"
he continues, "that they originated from the Vaudois,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">{102}</a></span>
who fled before the Crusaders into Germany, Bohemia,
and Poland, and thence into the imperial territories. They
pay great attention to the Bible, and but little to the
priests, for which reason, probably, they have been so
hated by the latter." Again, he observes, "that it is
quite impossible to ascertain their numbers, or the proceedings
of their meetings, since, through fear of persecution,
they keep both entirely secret." A Russian historian
testifies to the same. "I have no means of determining
the numbers of the sect denominated Sabbaton, as
they have been estimated by various authorities at from
10,000 to 100,000. It is certain, however, that they are
harmless, simple, and inoffensive in their lives, and that
they avoid all publicity, having a good reason for so doing."
"I have been credibly informed," says the Rev. Joseph
Wolfe, in private correspondence, "that the Sabbatarians
in Russia are quite numerous, and are called Sabbaton."
In a work entitled "The Annals of Russia," which was
published at St. Petersburg, in 1796, and afterwards
translated into French by M. de Brissembourg, we are
told that these people are not only found in the large
cities, but that they had congregations in the remotest
parts of the empire,—in Siberia, and upon the northwest
coast of North America. This was proved to be the case
in 1829, when the Rev. J. S. Green, of the American Board
of Foreign Missions, visited a church of fifty communicants
on the northwest coast of Russian America, who religiously
observed the seventh day. He gives rather a deplorable
picture of their ignorance, but upon one point at least he
might have learned a lesson of them.

 <h3 class="nobreak">SECTION V.<br />
 <small>SOME ACCOUNT OF THE SABBATARIANS IN HOLLAND.</small></h3>

</div>

<p>In my foregoing statements I have been governed
entirely by the language and opinions of the writers from
whom I derived my information, and who are almost unanimous
in supposing that the Semi-Judaisers of Bohemia and
Transylvania were descendants of the primitive Waldenses.
However this may be, we have every reason to believe that
both these countries, with different parts of Germany and
Holland, were the abodes of evangelical Christians, and
probably of Sabbatarians, before the dispersion of the
Waldenses. An ancient author informs us that long
before the dawn of the Reformation in Germany, there lay
concealed in all these countries, particularly in Bohemia,
a class of persons who contended for the spiritual nature
of the kingdom of Christ, and that this kingdom should
be exempt from all human institutions, of which first-day
keeping is such a principal one. It is certain, however,
that they were first brought into public notice about this
time, and the probability is, that being similar to, they
became amalgamated with the persecuted Waldenses; and
as their safety lay in their obscurity, they took no pains to
form records to perpetuate their memories. This opinion
is further strengthened from the fact that many of the
Anabaptists of Holland, whose origin is confessedly hid in
the remote depths of antiquity, are known to have been
Sabbatarians, and the same was true of multitudes in the
Netherlands, or Low Countries, as we learn from Father
Lebo, a Spanish inquisitor, who accompanied the Duke of
Alva on his expedition to that unhappy country, of which
he wrote an account. He says, "Of all the heretics, none
were more incorrigible than a certain set, who were quite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">{104}</a></span>
numerous, who refused to pay any regard to the festivals
of the church, but persisted in Judaising, and openly declared
that the Mosaic ritual was still binding."</p>

<p>Of the origin of Sabbatarianism in Holland, however, we
have no account; neither have the names of its teachers
been handed down to us. Whether its first observers were
led to its adoption by an examination of the sacred records
alone, or whether the commandments there laid down, were
argued and explained by some popular leader, I have at present
no means of ascertaining. Certain it is that the Sabbath
controversy became, in the commencement of the sixteenth
century, the principal one of the age, in all those northern
Germanic countries, and engaged not only the attention of
prelates and doctors of divinity, but of princes and sovereign
states. In this controversy learning was opposed to ignorance,
and influence to obscurity. Wealth, talent, and
civil power, were arrayed on the side of the No-Sabbath
doctrine. Here I would remark, that the Sabbatarians in
Europe, at this period, were engaged in a controversy, which,
originating upon different principles, required to be managed
in altogether a different manner, from the present controversial
discussions of the Sabbath question. The change
of the Sabbath at this time had not been broached. It
was conceded by all that the Dominical day was a mere
festival of the church, brought in and perpetuated by
human authority, and the mass of the people, with the so-called
great Reformers at their head, contended that all
sabbatical statutes had been abrogated, and consequently
that, under the present dispensation, it was a matter of
perfect expediency, whether or not any day of rest was
observed. On the contrary, the Sabbatarians maintained
that a Divine law could only be abrogated by its institutor,
that the law of the Sabbath had not been so abrogated, and
consequently, that it must be still in force. They appealed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">{105}</a></span>
to the Scriptures; the opposite party appealed to the sword:
and though the arguments of the former could never be
answered in a satisfactory manner, their upholders could
be hushed in death or driven into exile. One of the most
eminent and learned men of this age, was a Sabbatarian,
and a bold advocate of Sabbatarian views. I refer to
Grotius, who wrote and published a book, in which he
proved that the ten commandments are moral and immutable,
and consequently the law of the Sabbath is still
binding. This book was condemned in the celebrated
council convened at Dort in 1618, and its author denounced
in the severest manner. But however much this distinguished
man contributed to support the Sabbatarian cause,
he was certainly not its founder. A Catholic historian, in
treating of the Anabaptists in Holland, at the commencement
of the sixteenth century, remarks, that, "these heretics,
through the instigation of the devil, for their overthrow,
were divided among themselves, part teaching one thing,
and part another; for, though all unanimously rejected the
holy sacraments of the church, and refused to obey its
ordinances, a certain set were for going back to Moses for
a Sabbath, in which matter, they went so far as to form
congregations, and hold meetings on the seventh day."
In another place he observes, "I never heard that they
were persecuted by their brethren, the other Anabaptists,
except by the way of jeers, scoffs, and ridicule."<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_33" id="Ref_33" href="#Foot_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>Again, "The followers of Moses being chiefly among the
poorer classes, they escaped for a long time the notice of
the civil authorities, and so greatly increased in numbers, that
they had teachers and congregations in all the principal cities
of Holland, but when the persecutions broke out, some fled,
others conformed, and their meetings were generally broken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">{106}</a></span>
up." It is well known that the Lutheran princes and prelates
practised upon the Anabaptists all the cruelties to which
themselves had been subjected by the Roman hierarchs.
The names of Luther, Calvin, and Zuinglius, have been
marked in this manner with an indelible stain. The conscientious
Sabbatarians neither expected nor found sympathy
in the bosoms of these men. Luther, who could send
a circular to the princes of the empire, urging them to
execute summary vengeance upon the heretical sect, and
who bitterly denounced Carlostadt for sympathizing with
them; Calvin, who could smile with complacency over the
tortures of those who refused to be governed by his own
opinions; and Zuinglius, who, when questioned regarding
the fate of certain Anabaptists, replied, "Drown the
Dippers,"—what sympathy could be expected from princes
whose consciences were guided, and whose opinions were
influenced by such men? and is it a wonder, that while the
horrible scenes of the Inquisition were re-enacted in Protestant
countries; that while women and children, old men
and maidens, indeed, a multitude of all classes, were being
drowned, hung, burned, racked, and crowded into prisons
to be literally starved to death; is it a wonder, I say, that
under all these circumstances, posterity is beginning to
inquire whether they were reformers or deformers, and
whether pure and undefiled religion was really benefited by
their services? This inquiry appears the more rational, when
we consider that it was for being baptized as baptism was
practised in the primitive church, and, so far as the
Sabbatarians were concerned, for observing the Sabbath
that God had commanded, that these frightful persecutions
were carried on. Although many Sabbatarians doubtlessly
perished, the name of only one martyr known to have been
of that faith has been preserved. This was Barbary Von
Thiers, who had been baptized by a Sabbatarian minister
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">{107}</a></span>
named Stephen Benedict. At her examination, she declared
her rejection of Sunday and the holydays of the church,
but said that "the Lord God had commanded rest on the
seventh day;" in this she acquiesced, and it was her desire,
by the help and grace of God, to remain as she was, for it
was the true faith and right way in Christ. At the time
when the Arminian schism was creating such a great
excitement in Holland, the Sabbatarians appear to have
become amalgamated, at least to a certain extent, with that
people. Both were equally obnoxious to the state, and
that of itself would have created a sympathy between
them. It is well known that Grotius embraced the
Arminian tenets. Maurice, at that time the reigning
prince, exerted his utmost efforts to crush both parties.
Inquiries were set on foot with all the rigours of the Inquisition.
The suspected were tortured not so much to make
them criminate themselves, as to betray their friends and
associates. Some were beheaded, and others escaped into
foreign countries. Of the latter class was Grotius, who,
being condemned to perpetual imprisonment, escaped his
doom by flight. Their houses were demolished, their property
confiscated, and every measure that tyranny and
malice could invent, was exerted for their extirpation.
Partially, at least, these efforts were attended with success,
and since that period few Sabbatarians have been found in
that country.</p>

<div class="section">

 <h3 class="nobreak">SECTION VI.<br />
 <small>SEVENTH-DAY BAPTISTS OF ENGLAND.</small></h3>

</div>

<p>About sixty years after the ascension of our Lord,
Christianity was first introduced into Britain, and many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">{108}</a></span>
of the nobility, as well as those of inferior birth, were happily
converted. As it can be proved that, at this early
period, the seventh day was observed by the Christians in
general, we may conclude that these primitive churches
were Sabbatarian. The British Christians experienced
various changes of prosperity and adversity, until about
the year 600, when Austin, the monk, with forty associates,
was sent hither to subject the island to the dominion of
Rome. Various ancient authors might be quoted to prove
the Sabbatarian character of the English at this period.
In the Biography of Austin, published in the Lives of the
Saints, we are told that he found the people of Britain in
the most grievous and intolerable heresies, being given to
Judaising, but ignorant of the holy sacraments and festivals
of the church. The author then goes on to relate the
prodigies wrought in their conversion.</p>

<p>The terms of conformity proposed to these Christians by
Austin related, among other things, to the observation of
Easter and the festivals of the Romish church. A division
among the people immediately ensued, and the different
branches of the church were designated as the old
and the new. The old, or Sabbatarian Baptist church
retained their original principles; while the new adopted
the keeping of the Dominical day, infant baptism, and the
other superstitions of the Romish hierarchy.</p>

<p>Benius' Councils, fol. 1448, says that a council was celebrated
in Scotland in 1203, in which the initiation or first
bringing in of the Lord's day was determined. Lucius
says of this council, that "it was enacted that the Dominical
day should be holy, beginning at the twelfth hour on
Saturday, until Monday." "The same year," says Hoveden,
"Eustachius, Archbishop of Flay, returned into
England, and therein preached the word of God from
city to city, and from place to place, and said the command
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">{109}</a></span>
under written, came from heaven about the observation of
the Dominical day; that it was found in a letter at Jerusalem,
on the tomb of St. Simeon, which the Archbishop,
after fasting, praying, and doing penance, at length ventured
to take and read, which was as follows:</p>

<p>"I, the Lord, who commanded you that you should
observe the Dominical holy day, and ye have not kept it,
and ye have not repented of your sins, as I said by my
gospel. Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my word
shall not pass away. I have caused repentance unto life
to be preached unto you, and ye have not believed. I
sent Pagans against you, who shed your blood, yet ye
believed not; and because ye kept not the Dominical holy
day, for a few days ye had famine. But I soon gave you
plenty, and afterwards ye did worse. I will again, that
none, from the ninth hour of the Sabbath,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_34" id="Ref_34" href="#Foot_34">[34]</a></span> until the rising
of the sun on Monday, do work anything, unless what is
good, which, if any do, let him amend by repentance.</p>

<p>"And if ye be not obedient to this command, amen, I
say unto you, and I swear unto you, by my seat and
throne, and cherubim, who keep my holy seat, because I
will not command anything by another epistle, but I will
open the heavens, and for rain I will rain upon you stones,
and logs of wood, and hot water by night, that none may
be able to prevent, that I may destroy all wicked men.
This I say unto you; ye shall die the death; because of
the holy Dominical day, and other festivals of my saints,
which ye have not kept, I will send unto you beasts having
the heads of women, and the tails of camels; and they
shall be so hunger-starved that they shall devour your
flesh."</p>

<p>There is more of this wretched stuff; but let this suffice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">{110}</a></span>
as a specimen of the arts and intrigues used to impose
upon the simple and unsuspecting, by a forged letter purporting
to be from heaven.</p>

<p>The same author goes on to state that "the king and
government of England opposed the discontinuance of the
markets upon the Dominical day, and required that those
who observed it in such a way should be brought to the
king's court to make satisfaction, or otherwise purge
themselves of the observance of the Dominical day."</p>

<p>In this connexion I will just add a few more expedients
of the Romanists at that time to deceive the people of
England into a superstitious veneration for the first day.</p>

<p>"But our Lord Jesus Christ, whom we ought to obey
rather than man, who, made famous and exceedingly renowned,
dedicated unto himself this day, which we call
the Dominical or Lord's day, by his birth, and by his
resurrection, by his coming, and by the sending of the
Holy Spirit upon his disciples, he raised up miracles of his
virtue, and thus manifested it upon some transgressors of
the Dominical day:</p>

<p>"Upon a certain Sabbath, after the ninth hour, a certain
carpenter in Beverlac, making a wooden pin against
the wholesome admonition of his wife, being struck with a
palsy, fell to the ground. A certain woman, knitting
after the ninth hour of the Sabbath, whilst she was very
anxious to knit out part of her work, falling to the earth,
struck with the palsy, she became dumb. And at Nosfortum,
a village of Master Roger Arundel, a certain man
made for himself bread, baked under the ashes, on the
Sabbath, after the ninth hour, and eat of it, and reserved
to himself part until the morning, which when he brake,
upon the Dominical day, blood came out of it. And he
that saw it hath given testimony, and his testimony is
true.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">{111}</a></span>
"And at Wakefield, upon a certain Sabbath, when a
miller, after the ninth hour, endeavoured to grind corn,
suddenly, in the place of meal, there issued out so great a
stream of blood, and the mill-wheel stood immovable
against the vehement impulse of the water; and those
who saw marvelled, saying, 'Forgive, Lord, forgive thy
people!' And at Lincolnshire, a certain woman had prepared
dough, or paste, or pudding pie, which carrying to
the oven, after the ninth hour of the Sabbath, she put into
a very hot oven; and when she had drawn it out, she
found it not baked, and she put it again into the oven,
made very hot; and on the morning, and on Monday,
when she thought to have found the bread baked, she
found the dough unbaked. Also, in the same province,
when a certain woman had prepared her dough, willing to
carry it to the oven, her husband said, 'It is the Sabbath:—the
ninth hour is now past. Let it alone until Monday.'
And the woman, obeying her husband, did as he commanded,
and wrapped the dough in linen, and, in the
morning, when she went to look at the dough, lest it
should exceed the vessel, because of the leaven put into it,
she found, by divine will, bread made thereof, and well
baked with material fire. This is a change of the right
hand of the Most High; and although the Almighty Lord,
by these and other miracles of his power, did invite the
people to the observation of the Dominical day, yet the people,
fearing more kingly and human power than divine, and
fearing more those who kill the body, and can do no more,
than Him who, after killing the body, can send the soul to
hell, and fearing more to lose earthly things than heavenly,
and transitories than eternals, as a dog to the vomit,
returned to keep markets of things saleable upon the
Dominical day."</p>

<p>The term Sabbath, during all this period, was applied
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">{112}</a></span>
exclusively to the seventh day. Indeed, whenever, for
fourteen or fifteen centuries, that name occurs, it must be
understood as applying to the last day of the week. Up
to the present time, on the records of England, particularly
on the Journals of the House of Lords, the highest
court of England, all things entered as done on the seventh
day are entered as done die Sabbati, upon the Sabbath
day. From the time of Constantine to the Reformation,
Sunday was never regarded as the Sabbath, nor called by
that sacred name. During all this time, in England, here
and there, were found individuals who observed the Sabbath—the
seventh day of the week—strictly, though exposed
to many privations and frequent persecutions. Of
their numbers or their locations we have at present but
very imperfect accounts. The mass of men regarded the
Sabbath as abolished;—Sunday as no Sabbath, but merely
a church-holiday, to which they paid no conscientious
regard. With the dawn of the Reformation a new spirit
of inquiry was awakened in regard to the duties of practical
godliness. Among the subjects for discussion we find
the Sabbath early introduced and thoroughly examined.
There was one class of reformers who, dwelling alone on
the sufficiency of faith and the freeness of the Gospel,
trembled at the thought of imposing rules upon men, and
expressed a sort of holy horror at the term, "law." Of
this description were Luther and Calvin. It is well known
that the former recommended to Christians "to ride, dance,
and feast," on Sunday, rather than to submit to any infringement
of the liberty of conscience. But there were
others, who contended that an institution given in Paradise,
and enforced by one of the commandments of the
Decalogue, could not have been abolished; yet, finding
themselves in the dilemma of observing another day than
that originally appointed, they maintained that the day
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">{113}</a></span>
had been changed so early as to justify us in allowing it.
A third class contended that an institution so early given,
and so often enforced, could not have been abolished or
changed without explicit authority; that this explicit
authority had never been given; and, therefore, the
seventh day of the week, and that only, should be observed.
Compared with the whole, the number who
acknowledged the perpetuity and morality of the Sabbath,
and manifested a sacred regard for either the first or the
seventh day, was small. However, they were sufficient to
prove that wherever the subject of the Sabbath has been
considered, there has always been found those who, by
precept and example, have witnessed for the Sabbath of
the fourth commandment.</p>

<p>In 1595, a book was written and published by Dr. Bound,
in which the morality of the Sabbath, and a change of the
day, was advocated in quite a masterly manner. This
excited a controversial spirit, and was soon followed by
many others, both for and against his view. The orthodoxal
doctrine of the Church of England, by bishops and
historians, then was, that the Sabbath had been abolished,
and that the Lord's day, so called, was altogether another
institution, which could not be enforced by the fourth
commandment. Among the men who held this view, we
may mention Dr. Francis White, Lord Bishop of Ely,
Dr. Peter Heylyn, Edward Brerewood, Gilbert Ironsides,
and others. Against these men were arrayed the leading
Puritans, who maintained the morality of the Sabbath and
the necessity of restraining men by the sanctions of the
fourth commandment. Many true Sabbatarians, however,
stood opposed to both these parties, maintaining not only
the morality of the Sabbath, but the obligation to observe
the seventh day of the week. A work supporting this view,
from the pen of Theophilus Brabourne, appeared in 1628.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">{114}</a></span>
He took the position that the fourth commandment was
simply and entirely moral; that the seventh day of the
week ought to be an everlasting holyday in the Christian
Church; and that the Sunday is an ordinary working day,
which it is superstition and will-worship to make the Sabbath
of the fourth commandment. This view was adopted
by considerable numbers in England, and has been represented
from that day to this, by men of learning and piety.
Many who remained in connexion with the established
church, were conscientious observers of the seventh day
Sabbath, among whom were several ministers of piety,
and authors of eminence.</p>

<p>About the same time, small dissenting parties began to
organize churches and to boldly maintain the worship of
God upon the Sabbath. Of these the Natton Church
has been much celebrated. It is situated in the west of
England, near Tewksbury, and about fifteen miles from
Gloucester, thirty-five from Birmingham, and ninety from
London. The first pastor of this church whose name has
come down to us was Mr. John Purser. He is represented
as a very worthy man, and a great sufferer for conscience
sake. He was descended from an honourable family, and
was heir to a considerable estate, but his father disinherited
him because he observed the seventh day for the Sabbath.
Notwithstanding this wrong, it pleased Divine Providence
to bless him abundantly in the little that he possessed.
He became a respectable farmer, and lived at Ashton-upon-Carrant,
in the Parish of Ashchurch, in the county
of Gloucester, during the reigns of Charles and James
the Second. In common with other nonconformists, he
experienced much oppression and great opposition on
account of his religion. At one time his persecutors
came upon him while he was engaged in ploughing a
field, and took from him his team and utensils of husbandry.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">{115}</a></span>
Notwithstanding the severity of the laws against
dissenters, the officers, in many instances, far exceeded
their commission, and sometimes were made to suffer for
it. Such was the case in this instance; for one William
Surman, Esq., a conformist, but worthy man, seeing
the cruelty and injustice of thus depriving an honest man
of his property and the means for procuring a livelihood,
obliged his adversaries to return the property
thus wrongfully taken. It appears from authentic testimonies
that he suffered much during the persecutions
between 1660 and 1690. But he overcame all by faith
and patience, and came out of the furnace like gold doubly
refined.</p>

<p>It is probable that Mr. Purser commenced his ministry
in 1660, but did not receive ordination until some years
later. In the mean time one Mr. Cowell was the chief
preacher at Natton, and an author of some eminence,
having published a book entitled "The Snare Broken,"
which seems to have occasioned considerable difficulty
between the observers of the first and seventh day. Mr.
Cowell appears to have been rather wavering and unstable,
but withal a pious and well-meaning man. He departed
this life in 1680, when Mr. Purser took the principal charge
of the church. The Sabbatarians at this time were widely
scattered. There was no meeting-house, and Mr. Purser
opened his dwelling for that purpose. He also held meetings
at various other private houses, in different places, by
which those living at a distance were accommodated by his
labours. It may be remarked, that although this worthy
man steadily pursued the occupation of husbandry, and
reared a large family, he faithfully served the church.
While his hands were industriously employed, his meditations
were upon things above, and upon these occasions he
was highly favoured with manifestations of the divine presence.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">{116}</a></span>
All his children and grandchildren were also distinguished
for virtue and piety, though many of them
adopted the first day for the sake of convenience, and became
worthy members of Baptist churches. Mr. Purser,
through age and infirmity, was unable to discharge the
duties of the sacred office for some time before his death,
which occurred in 1720.</p>

<p>His successor, Mr. Edmund Townsend, was plain and
unobtrusive in his manners, but was highly respected for
his candour and integrity. Soon after his ordination he
took up his residence for a time with the Mill-Yard Church;
and then, in 1727, accepted an invitation to become the
pastor of the Cripplegate fraternity, which had been left
destitute by the death of Joseph Stennett.</p>

<p>When Mr. Townsend left this church, he was succeeded
by Mr. Philip Jones, who discharged the duties pertaining
to this sacred office for nearly fifty years. His colleague,
Mr. Thomas Boston, was a young man of great promise and
usefulness. Mr. Jones lived for several years at Cheltenham,
but held meetings at Natton, Panford, and other towns,
for the purpose of accommodating members living at each
of those places. In 1731, he removed to Upton, but continued
his ministry in different places. In this way he
encountered many difficulties, sometimes having to travel
in the worst of weather, and at others running great risks
from the floods of the Severn and Avon. Yet neither
dangers nor inconveniences were suffered to interfere with
his duty. His character has been thus given by a contemporary:
"He was a holy man of God, and a great and
lively preacher of the gospel. Few were better acquainted
with the scriptures; for, whatever his subject was, he could
have chapter and verse to prove the whole. In short he
was a living concordance; a man of unblemished character,
a sincere friend, and a faithful reformer, but always in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">{117}</a></span>
spirit of meekness. Perhaps but a few living had a greater
command over the passions than he had."</p>

<p>Previous to the death of this worthy man, in 1770, Mr.
Thomas Hiller, his nephew, accepted the pastoral care of
the Baptist church in Tewksbury, near Natton. He was
a Sabbatarian in both opinion and practice, and consequently
was invited to serve the Sabbath-keeping church
at the same time that he remained pastor of the First-day
Baptist church. He accepted the invitation, and continued
to minister to both churches until his death, a few years
ago. His ministry is said to have been successful in both
Natton and Tewksbury; although in what that success
was seen it would probably be problematical to determine.
The church over which he presided has become a mere
handful, in the greatest want of spiritual strength and
support. Mr. Hiller was doubtlessly a man of worth, and
deeply interested in the Spiritual welfare of both churches,
by whom his memory is still highly venerated; but the
history of his connexion with these fraternities proves
that no man can successfully serve two masters. It is
barely possible that a minister of the gospel, who is at one
and the same time the pastor of one church worshipping on
the seventh day of the week, and another church worshipping
on the first day of the week, can be faithful to both.
Since the death of Mr. Hiller, the congregation at Natton
have been without a pastor. However, it has engaged the
services of a worthy Baptist minister from Tewksbury for
a considerable time.</p>

<p>It is worthy of note, that, in 1746, Mr. Benjamin Purser,
the youngest son of Rev. John Purser before mentioned,
purchased an estate in the village of Natton, and fitted up,
at his own expense, a chapel for divine worship, adjoining
his dwelling-house. It is a small room, distinguished only
for neatness and convenience. He also walled in a corner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">{118}</a></span>
of his orchard for a burial-place. When he died, in 1765,
he donated the house and burial-place to the church, together
with ten pounds a year out of his estate to all succeeding
ministers. At the present time the congregation
is so small that the chapel is not opened except upon extraordinary
occasions, such as a funeral or the like. It serves,
however, as the depository for a small collection of rare
and valuable books.</p>

<h4>THE CRIPPLEGATE CHURCH.</h4>

<p>A congregation of Sabbatarians, known under that
denomination, was gathered in London by Francis Bampfield,
during the reign of Charles the Second. Mr. Bampfield
was descended from an ancient and honourable family
in Devonshire, and was a brother of Thomas Bampfield,
Speaker in one of Cromwell's Parliaments. Having been
designed for the ministry from childhood, he received a
classical education, at Wadham College, Oxford, where he
remained for eight years. Subsequently he was provided
with a living in Dorsetshire, and was likewise chosen Prebend
of Exeter Cathedral. Thence he was transferred to
the populous town of Sherburne, where he exerted a most
extensive and happy influence among the members of the
established church. In this connexion he continued only
a short time; for beginning to doubt the authority of the
church to prescribe forms of worship, he became in the end
a decided nonconformist. Consequently he was not only
ejected from the ministry, but confined in Dorchester jail,
for preaching and conducting religious services contrary to
law. During his imprisonment, which continued about
eight years, his views upon the subjects of the Sabbath and
baptism were materially changed, and he became a decided
advocate of Seventh-day Baptist sentiments. He preached
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">{119}</a></span>
his new opinions boldly to his fellow-prisoners, and several
were led to embrace them. Soon after his release from
Dorchester, Mr. Bampfield went to London, where he
preached the gospel for about ten years. In Bethnal
Green, in the eastern parts of London, he gathered a small
church, whose place of meeting was in his own hired house.
This church was organized in 1676, and Mr. Bampfield
continued its pastor until 1682, when he was brought before
the Court of Sessions, on a variety of charges connected
with his nonconformity. He was several times examined,
and upon each examination required to take the oath of
allegiance, which he persisted in refusing, alleging that his
conscience would not allow him to take it. This resulted
in his condemnation, the forfeiture of his goods, and a
sentence of imprisonment during life, or what was equivalent,
during the king's pleasure. The anxieties incident
to this trial, combined with a naturally feeble constitution,
together with his great privations, brought on a disease, of
which he died in Newgate prison, on the 15th of February,
1684, aged 68 years.</p>

<p>The imprisonment of Mr. Bampfield was followed by
the dispersion of his flock, but the times becoming more
favourable, they reunited in church fellowship in 1686, and
invited Mr. Edward Stennett, of Wallingford, to accept
the pastoral care of their church. He partly complied,
coming to London at stated periods to preach and administer
the ordinances, though he still retained his connexion
with the people at Wallingford. But finding that
he could not consistently serve both churches, he resigned
the pastoral care of the London church in 1689. Mr.
Stennett is distinguished as being the ancestor of the
famous Stennett family, who were all Sabbatarians, and
were for several generations an ornament to religion, and
champions for the cause of Protestant dissent. Being on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">{120}</a></span>
the side of Parliament in the civil wars, he was exposed, in
consequence, to the neglect of his relations and many
other difficulties. Although a faithful minister, he possessed
no stated salary, but supported his family by the
practice of physic. He bore a part in the persecutions
which fell upon the Dissenters of that time. In several
instances his escape seems altogether miraculous, and
affords a striking evidence of Divine interposition.</p>

<p>He was succeeded by his second son, Joseph Stennett,
who had enjoyed the advantages of a liberal education.
He came to London in 1685, and was employed for a time
in the instruction of youth. His first appearance in the
pulpit created a great sensation. His ministry was eminently
evangelical and faithful; and while preaching constantly
to his own church upon the Sabbath, he almost
always waited in the ministry upon other congregations on
the first day. Perhaps no Dissenting minister in England,
at that time, exerted a more powerful influence, or maintained
a higher standing than did Mr. Stennett. He was
at different times appointed by his brethren in the ministry
to draw up letters and addresses of congratulation to be
presented to the sovereign upon particular occasions, Mr.
Stennett likewise appeared before the public as the author
of other works, which acquired considerable popularity.
Early in the year 1713, he began to decline, and on the
11th of July fell asleep, in the forty-ninth year of his age,
and the twenty-third of his ministry.</p>

<p>The death of this worthy man was a particularly disastrous
event to his little flock, who remained for fourteen
years without a shepherd, during which time they generally
met for worship with the Mill-Yard Church. But in 1727,
Mr. Edmund Townsend became their spiritual guide, in
which relation he continued until his death in 1763.</p>

<p>Subsequent to the decease of Mr. Townsend, the church,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">{121}</a></span>
for four years, was supplied with ministerial assistance
by different Baptist ministers, until Mr. Thomas Whitewood
accepted the pastoral office, in June, 1767. His
race, however, was short; for after preaching three times,
and administering the Lord's Supper once, he was attacked
by a fatal disease, of which he died the ensuing October.</p>

<p>Dr. Samuel Stennett, son of Dr. Joseph Stennett, being
at that period pastor of the Baptist church in Little Wild
Street, London, was solicited to accept the pastoral office.
It appears that he complied in part, performing all the
duties without accepting the nominal relation of pastor.
He administered the Lord's Supper, and preached to them
regularly on the Sabbath morning; while the afternoon
service was conducted by four Baptist ministers in rotation,
among whom were Dr. Jenkins and Dr. Rippon.</p>

<p>In 1785, Robert Burnside accepted the pastoral charge
of this church, in which relation he continued forty-one
years. Mr. Burnside united to great natural abilities, a
kind and loving heart, by which he was particularly qualified
to impart instruction. He became tutor, at different
periods, to the sons of several of the nobility, and discharged
the duties attendant upon that difficult office in a
manner honourable to himself, and advantageous to his
pupils. He also prepared several works for the press;
among which was a volume on the subject of the Sabbath.
He died in 1826, and was succeeded by John Brittain
Shenstone, whose early labours had been in connexion with
First-day Baptist churches. For more than forty years he
was connected with the Board of Baptist ministers in
London, of which he appears to have been the principal
projector and main support. He commenced the observation
of the Sabbath in 1825, and upon the decease of Mr.
Burnside accepted the pastoral care of the church, which
he continued to serve until his death, in 1844. Since that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">{122}</a></span>
event this church has been without a pastor, and is in a
very low and enfeebled condition.</p>

<h4>THE MILL-YARD CHURCH.</h4>

<p>This church is located in the eastern part of London,
but of its founder, or the date of its origin, our accounts
are very imperfect and unsatisfactory. The present records,
in possession of the church, date back to 1673; but
as they refer to another book which had been previously
used, it is certain that the church was organized much
earlier. Indeed, we have every reason to believe that this
church is a perpetuation of the fraternity gathered by John
James, the martyr, which originally met in Bull-Steak
Alley, Whitechapel. We shall therefore consider Mr.
James as the first pastor of this church. On the 19th
day of October, 1661, while in the midst of a warm and
fervent discourse, an officer entered the place of worship,
forcibly ejected him from the pulpit, and led him away to
the police under a strong guard. Thirty members of his
congregation were likewise taken before a bench of justices,
then convened at a public house in the vicinity, where each
one was required to take the oath of allegiance, and those
who refused to comply were committed to prison. Mr.
James underwent a long and tedious examination, when he
was committed to Newgate, upon the testimony of several
profligate witnesses, by whom he was accused of speaking
treasonable words against the king. At his trial, which
came on about one month afterwards, his apparent innocence,
deep piety, and resignation, sensibly affected a large
concourse of spectators, but could not soften the obdurate
hearts of his judges, by whom he was sentenced to be
hanged, drawn, and quartered. He was unaffected by
this horrid sentence, and calmly observed, "Blessed be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">{123}</a></span>
God, whom man condemneth, God justifieth." While he
lay in prison under sentence of death, he was visited by
several persons of distinction, who were deeply affected by
his patience and resignation, and who cheerfully engaged
to exert their utmost influence to secure his pardon. But
he appears to have been too well acquainted with the
power and designs of his enemies, to have entertained much
hopes of their success.</p>

<p>Mrs. James, by the advice of her friends, was induced
to present a petition twice to the king, setting forth her
husband's innocence, and entreating his majesty to grant
a pardon. But in both instances she was repulsed with
scoffs and ridicule. At the scaffold, on the day of his execution,
he addressed the people in a very sensible and
affectionate manner. Having finished the address, and
kneeling down, he thanked God for covenant mercies, and
for conscious innocence. He then prayed for all, both his
friends and his enemies, for the executioner, for the people
of God, for the spectators, for his church, and his family,
and lastly, for himself, that he might enjoy a sense of the
divine presence and support in this his hour of trial, and
entrance into glory. When he had finished, the executioner,
who was much affected, said, "The Lord receive
your soul;" to which Mr. James replied, "I thank you."
A friend then observed to him, "This is a happy day for
you;" he replied, "I thank God it is." He then thanked
the sheriff for his courtesy, and bade farewell to his
friends; then saying, "Father, into thy hands I commit
my spirit," was launched into eternity. But the rage of
the bigoted tyrant did not end here. His heart was taken
from his body and burned, his body itself quartered, and
the mutilated parts affixed to the gates of the city, and his
head set up in Whitechapel, on a pole opposite to the alley
in which his meeting-house stood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">{124}</a></span>
At the time when the present record of this church
commences, 1673, William Sellers exercised the pastoral
function. The church was then in a flourishing condition;
the members being quite numerous, and strict discipline
maintained. Mr. Sellers was probably the author of a
work on the Sabbath, in review of Dr. Owen, which appeared
in 1671. His ministry is supposed to have continued
until 1678. He was succeeded by Mr. Toursby,
who was a man of considerable controversial talent, which
he exercised in defence of the Sabbath. He prepared a
work for the press upon that subject, but it is believed
that it has long been out of print. His ministry ceased
in 1710.</p>

<p>About this time two persons named Slater preached occasionally,
though it does not appear that they were ever
ordained.</p>

<p>Mr. Savage, in 1711, accepted the pastoral office. His
colleague, the venerable John Maulden, had long been the
pastor of a Baptist Church in Goodman's Fields, which he
left on account of his having embraced Sabbatarian principles.
After the decease of these worthy men, the pastoral
office was vacant for some time, during which the preaching
brethren officiated in the ministry in a manner prescribed
at the business meetings of the church. In 1720,
Dr. Joseph Stennett was invited to accept the pastoral care
of this church. He was then presiding over a Baptist
Church in Exeter, and after considerable delay declined the
call.</p>

<p>Mr. Robert Cornthwaite became their pastor in 1726.
He had been connected with the Established Church, but
becoming convinced that the gospel did not authorize any
such establishment, he withdrew from its communion and
identified himself with the dissenters. Becoming interested
in the Sabbath controversy he soon decided for the seventh
day, and was chosen pastor of this church, in which relation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">{125}</a></span>
he continued until his death in 1754. He was distinguished
for great mental vigour, and a firm adherence to
whatever he deemed true and scriptural. He published
several works relating to the Sabbath, which greatly contributed
to draw attention to that important subject.</p>

<p>Daniel Noble, his successor, was a member of a Sabbath-keeping
family, and being designed for the ministry, received
the advantages of a liberal education. His studies
were pursued first in London, and afterward at the Glasgow
University. He commenced preaching occasionally
at Mill-Yard in 1752, took the pastoral charge when that
office became vacant, in which connexion he remained until
his death in 1783.</p>

<p>At this time William Slater, a member of the church,
was invited to conduct the services. This he did with such
general acceptance that he received ordination, and became
the pastor of the church. His ministry was very successful,
and continued until he died, in 1819.</p>

<p>For several years ensuing that event the church was
without a pastor, being supplied with ministerial assistance
by brethren of other denominations, until William Henry
Black, the present incumbent, became its spiritual guide.
Through the pious liberality of one of its members, the
Mill-Yard Church enjoys the benefit of an endowment.
Mr. Joseph Davis, who united in its connexion at the time
that John James suffered martyrdom, purchased, in 1691,
the grounds adjoining the present Mill-Yard Church, erected
the place of worship, and provided for the permanency of
the society. This property was conveyed to trustees, appointed
by the church, in 1700. In 1706, shortly before
his death, Mr. Davis bequeathed his property to his son,
with an annual rent-charge in favour of the Mill-Yard
Church, together with seven other Sabbatarian churches in
England. He likewise provided, conditionally, that his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">{126}</a></span>
whole property might afterward come into the possession
of the church, and be vested in trustees for its benefit.
Mr. Davis, in the earlier part of his life, had suffered extremely
from severe persecutions. He was a prisoner in
Oxford Castle for nearly ten years, from which he was
released in 1673. Subsequently he entered into business
in London, where prosperity attended him, and he not
only obtained a competence, but became a wealthy man.
Few have made a more laudable use of riches, and I would
say to the reader, go thou, and do likewise.</p>

<p>A short account of some of the most eminent among
those who embraced Sabbatarianism previous to the organization
of these churches, may be interesting to the general
reader.</p>

<p>Shortly after the publication of Dr. Bound's book, in
which he advanced the modern notion regarding the so-called
Christian Sabbath, that it is a perpetuation of the
fourth commandment, but that the day specified therein
had been changed by divine authority, we first hear of John
Traske, who both wrote and spoke in defence of the
seventh day.</p>

<p>He also contended that the scriptures are sufficient to
direct in religious services, and that the state has no right
to prescribe any ordinances contrary to the laws of God.
For this he was brought before the Star-Chamber, where
a long discussion was held respecting the Sabbath, in which
Dr. Andrews, Bishop of Winchester, took a prominent part.
Traske could not be turned from his opinion, but received
a censure in the Star-Chamber. "He was sentenced on
account of his being a Sabbatarian," says Paggitt's Heresiography,
"to be set upon the Pillory at Westminster, and
from thence to be whipped to the Fleet Prison, there to
remain a prisoner for three years. His wife, Mrs. Traske,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">{127}</a></span>
was confined in Maiden Lane and the Gate House Prisons
fifteen years, where she died, for the same crime."</p>

<p>Another distinguished advocate for the truth was Theophilus
Brabourne, a learned minister in connexion with
the Established Church. He wrote a book, which was
published in London in 1628, wherein he argued that the
Lord's Day is not the Sabbath by divine institution, but
"that the seventh day is still in force." For this, and
similar works, he was arraigned before the Lord Archbishop
of Canterbury, and the Court of High Commission. His
examination was conducted in the presence of many persons
of high distinction, and several lords of his Majesty's
Privy Council. For some reason, it is not possible to
ascertain distinctly what, though probably he was over-awed
by the character of the assembly, he signed a recantation
and went back to the bosom of the church. Nevertheless
he continued to assert, that if the Sabbatic institution
be indeed moral and perpetually binding, the seventh day
ought to be sacredly kept.</p>

<p>About the same time, it appears that Philip Pandy
commenced propagating the same doctrines in the northern
parts of England. He was educated in the Established
Church, of which he became a minister. He withdrew from
its communion, however, and became the mark for many
shots. He held several important disputes about his peculiar
sentiments, and contributed much to promulgate them.</p>

<p>James Ockford, another early advocate of the Sabbath
in England, appears to have taken part in the discussions
in which Traske and Brabourne were engaged. He also
wrote and published a book in 1642, which was seized and
burned by the authorities of the Established Church.</p>

<p>There does not appear to have been any regularly organized
churches of Sabbatarians in England, until the commencement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">{128}</a></span>
of the seventeenth century, though subsequent
to that period there were eleven of these fraternities, besides
many scattered Sabbath-keepers, in different parts of
the kingdom. These churches were located in the following
places, viz.: Braintree, in Essex; Chersey; Norweston;
Salisbury, in Wiltshire; Sherbourne, in Buckinghamshire;
Natton, in Gloucestershire; Wallingford, in
Berkshire; Woodbridge, in Suffolk; and three in London—the
Mill-Yard, Cripplegate, and Pinner's Hall Churches.
Eight of the eleven are now extinct, and hence a complete
account of them cannot be obtained.</p>

<p>A very interesting correspondence between the Mill-Yard
Church and the General Conference of the Seventh-day
Baptists in the United States has been carried on for
the last fifty years. In 1844, George B. Utter, as delegate
from that body, visited the brethren in England, where
he was hospitably entertained. The worthy pastor of the
Mill-Yard Church is, I understand, collecting materials for
a history of the Lives and Writings of Sabbatarians in
England, and likewise preparing a list of Sabbatarian
authors, together with an account of all the books which
have been published that relate to the Sabbath controversy.</p>

<p>From an attention to the foregoing it will be perceived
that Sabbatarianism has greatly declined in England;
and that decline seems to have been produced by the operation
of a variety of causes. There are certainly great
inconveniences, particularly in large towns and cities, connected
with the observance of a day of rest so utterly at
variance with the popular custom as that of the seventh
day has ever been. This, with that spirit of conformity
by which men are ever prone to accede to established
usages, together with the fact that they never instituted
any associational organization, sufficiently accounts for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">{129}</a></span>
their early declension, without supposing any unsoundness
in their creed.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_35" id="Ref_35" href="#Foot_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>We have every reason to believe that formerly, and down
so late as the commencement of the seventeenth century,
Seventh-day Baptist churches, of considerable magnitude,
existed at the foot of the Grampians, and among the Welsh
mountains, but their history appears to be buried in oblivion.</p>

<p>I have also been recently informed that there is a Seventh-day
Baptist church near Burton-upon-Trent, and
nine miles from Derby. That a Mr. Witt, in 1832, officiated
as pastor. That they own a large brick meeting-house,
in which their meetings are solemnized every Sabbath
day, and are a very respectable body of people.</p>

Here is a vast field for research, of which the world is just beginning
to discover the importance. The martyrs, with the exception of
those who were destroyed by mobs, by clandestine malevolence, and
local crusades, were allowed formal trials according to the established
usages of law, which were generally in conformity to the Roman system
of jurisprudence. In these records of the old ecclesiastical courts, the
charges against them, with their apologies and confessions, are detailed
at length. Some of these documents have already been examined, but
multitudes of others lie concealed in the galleries of ancient libraries.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_19" id="Foot_19" href="#Ref_19">[19]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Reineirus, under the title of Waldenses, includes all the heretics of
that period, Pasaginians, Albigenses, Waldenses, Josephists, Arnoldists,
Henricians, &amp;c., from which it appears that these names were derived
from local causes.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_20" id="Foot_20" href="#Ref_20">[20]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
This of course included the keeping of the first day, which the
Catholics unanimously declare originated with their church.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_21" id="Foot_21" href="#Ref_21">[21]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the time of Reineirus, and even to this day, in Catholic countries,
the Dominical day is regarded as a feast, or festival of the church, as
much as Easter, Christmas, &amp;   c.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_22" id="Foot_22" href="#Ref_22">[22]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
These are particularly mentioned by Crantz, in his History of the
Bohemian Brethren.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_23" id="Foot_23" href="#Ref_23">[23]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
This is important testimony, because the Catholics never dreamed
of attempting to establish the sacredness of the first day from the authority
of the Scriptures, but referred it at once to the power of Holy
Mother Church. Consequently, the Dominical day was regarded as a
holyday of the church.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_24" id="Foot_24" href="#Ref_24">[24]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
It remained for more modern theologians to discover, that the inspired
writers were mistaken, and that instead of the seventh, it was a
seventh day, or the seventh part of time.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_25" id="Foot_25" href="#Ref_25">[25]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
First-day doubtlessly included, which is ever spoken of, by the
Catholic writers, as a festival of Christ, and a holyday of the Church,
and regarded in no other light.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_26" id="Foot_26" href="#Ref_26">[26]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Of this I would remark that the Dominical day was established by
law, not as the Sabbath, but as a festival of the church; and that whatever
uncertainty may exist about all the ancient heretics being Sabbatarians,
it is very certain that few, if any, of them were observers of
the first day, at least for a very long period.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_27" id="Foot_27" href="#Ref_27">[27]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
That the Catholic writers regarded the Dominical day as a festival
of the Church can be very easily proved. That they regard it as such
to this day in Catholic countries is an undeniable fact. When they
speak of the festivals of the Church, they include the Dominical day as
much as Christmas, Palm Sunday, or Easter. They smile when they
hear learned Protestant sages attempt to prove from the Scriptures
either the abrogation or a change of the Sabbath. We have also the
testimony of a host of Protestants in the earlier part of the Reformation,
who acknowledged that the observation of the first day had no
other foundation than the authority of the Church, among whom is the
celebrated John Calvin, who says—"The old fathers put in the place
of the Sabbath the day which we call Sunday. King Charles I. declares
that the celebration of the feast of Easter was instituted by the same
authority that changed the Sabbath into the Lord's day, or Sunday;
for it will not be found in Scripture where Saturday is discharged to
be kept, or turned into Sunday. Therefore, my opinion is, that those
who will not keep this feast may as well return to the observation of
Saturday, and refuse the weekly Sunday, since it was the Church's
authority that changed the one and instituted the other."</p>

 <small>SEVENTH-DAY BAPTISTS IN THE UNITED STATES.</small></h2>

 <h3 class="nobreak">SECTION I.<br />
 <small>GENERAL HISTORY.</small></h3>

</div>

<p><span class="smc">The</span> Seventh-day Baptist churches in the United States
occupy isolated situations in different parts of the Union,
and are distinguished from other religious denominations
by certain distinctive views relative to the immutability of
every precept of the moral law.</p>

<p>The term Sabbatarian was formerly adopted by those of
the same persuasion in England, subsequent to the Reformation,
when the word Sabbath was applied exclusively to
the seventh day of the week, and those observant of it as
holy time were regarded as the only Sabbath-keepers.
This term, though highly expressive of the main Sabbath
doctrine, was, on account of its supposed indefiniteness,
rejected by the General Conference of the American
Churches, in 1818, and the appellation of Seventh-day
Baptist, which was considered more generally expressive,
adopted in its stead.</p>

<p>The differences existing between the Seventh-day Baptists
and the other Baptist denominations, all relate to the
Sabbatical ordinance. In respect to this the former believe
that no system of morality can be complete which
does not include time devoted to God and religious worship;
that the seventh day was particularly appropriated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">{131}</a></span>
and set apart for this purpose in Paradise, and was
designed, not for any one class or race of men, but for all
mankind; that it forms a necessary part of the moral law,
which is immutable and unchangeable in its nature, and of
universal obligation; that no other day was substituted
for this by divine authority at the introduction of Christianity;
that the first day is nowhere mentioned in the
sacred volume as possessing a divine character; that whatever
respect was paid to it in the primitive ages originated
from the supposition that it was the weekly anniversary of
the glorious triumph of the risen Saviour, and not from
the idea of its being the Sabbath; and that the substitution
of the first for the seventh day, as holy time, was
brought about by the Antichristian power, who, according
to the word of prophecy, was to usurp the prerogatives of
the Deity, and change times and laws.</p>

<p>These opinions, though countenanced by Holy Writ, and
perfectly agreeable with many historical records, are
directly in opposition to the popular prejudices of the day,
and, consequently, their conscientious supporters have
been exposed, sometimes, to downright persecution in the
shape of fines and imprisonment, and at others, to the
equally cruel, though less ostensible, suffering imposed by
vituperative sarcasm and disingenuous ridicule.</p>

<p>We have all heard of a very expressive proverb, importing
that the world will think of us just as we think ourselves.
Perhaps the seventh-day people have not made
sufficient exhibitions of self-gratulation. Perhaps they
have walked too contentedly down the valley of humiliation,
involved in the shadows of obscurity. Certain it is,
that they have striven to make themselves acceptable to
God rather than to men; that they have been distinguished
more for morality, good sense, and quiet, unobtrusive
manners, than for brilliant, but superficial, attainments;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">{132}</a></span>
and that they have been rewarded, not by outbursts of
popular applause, not by a rising upon them of the sun of
worldly prosperity, but by the sweet consciousness of doing
right, and a slow but steady progress in Christian knowledge
and acquirements. The Seventh-day Baptist churches
have been blessed and honoured by the labours and example
of a succession of worthy ministers. Men, pre-eminently qualified
to break the bread of life, and administer
the milk of the word;—men truly apostolic in simplicity
and purity of doctrine, in fervour of piety and zeal. True,
they have not been distinguished for the wisdom of this
world. They have not rejoiced in the learning of Bossuet,
neither have they exhibited the eloquence of Bourdalone,
Massillon, or Whitefield; but they have adhered steadily
to the truth, have been uncompromising in opposition to
error, and little prone to seek worldly honours and emoluments.
Few of them have ever grown rich except in
grace; indeed, the possibility of opulence was precluded by
the cost of living, and the smallness of their salaries. The
same has also operated to prevent the accumulation of
large libraries by the ministry, or their devoting much time
to learned research or literary pursuits.</p>

<p>Few denominations of Christians have been equally distinguished
for fraternal feeling and unanimity of sentiment;—in
no one has society assumed a more healthy and
moral tone. Industry, frugality, and integrity, are their
leading characteristics; mendicity is rare among them, and
squalid poverty unknown.</p>

<p>Man is eminently a social being. No one perceives,
perhaps no one apprehends, how much society contributes
to strengthen and perfect the noblest virtues and highest
attainments. The affections are particularly under the
control and guidance of social influences. The interchange
of the forms of hospitality and courtesy powerfully promotes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">{133}</a></span>
the growth of friendship and kindliness of feeling.
Consequently, social worship is of the highest importance
to every Christian fraternity; and nothing is more productive
of congeniality of sentiment and unity of design
between churches of the same faith and order than frequent
convocations for mutual encouragement and edification.
The Seventh-day Baptists were aware of this, and,
accordingly, when the church in Newport, R. I., organized
a part of its members into a separate and distinct body,
now known as the First Hopkinton Church, it was stipulated
that an annual interview should take place, which
was subsequently known as the yearly meeting. Thus
was formed a little confederacy, whose bounds gradually
enlarged as new churches were instituted, until it included
the parent churches of Rhode Island, Connecticut, New
York, and New Jersey. These meetings were held alternately
at different places, and were usually attended by
the ministers and other leading members of the respective
churches, who generally travelled at their own expense,
and spent some time in this social and religious visit. The
consequences of this interchange of Christian sympathies
and feelings were every way delightful. The bonds of
union were cemented, many pleasing acquaintances were
formed, and a warm and growing attachment to the Sabbath,
and the cause of truth, increased in the minds of all.
So early as 1800, the churches composing this denomination
began to consider the expediency of establishing some
formal ecclesiastical organization. This was considered
the more necessary in consequence of certain differences in
some doctrinal sentiments that prevailed to a considerable
extent. The question was, under consideration until
1805, when, at a meeting convened at Hopkinton, certain
articles of union were agreed upon, and subscribed by delegates
from eight sister churches; and thus an ecclesiastical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">{134}</a></span>
body for the transaction of business was formed, which was
denominated the General Conference.</p>

<p>The second session of this venerable body was held at
Berlin, the third at Cohansey, now Shiloh, and the fourth
again at Hopkinton. In 1808, the Lost Creek and New
Salem churches, in Virginia, united with the Conference,
which subsequently received continual and almost annual
additions.</p>

<p>The meetings of this body were solemnized alternately
from place to place, and were attended with the most
happy consequences. Before the venerable body, whose
members were uniformly distinguished for integrity, candour,
and piety, all difficult cases were brought for consideration
and adjustment. Here divisions were reconciled,
schisms healed, and such differences as appeared
likely to disturb the general peace removed. Here, also,
religious and benevolent enterprises were projected and
recommended to the churches for their action and consideration.
The authority of the General Conference was
subject to several limitations, which will be perceived by
attending to the form and government of the Sabbatarian
fraternities. Every church is in itself a distinct body,
capable of transacting its own concerns, of receiving or
expelling members, of appointing its own pastor and other
officers, fixing their salaries, and suspending their ministrations
in case of impiety or gross immorality. The
internal regulations of these churches are simple and
democratic, every member being equally entitled to a
vote, and the pastor, except by the superior respect attached
to his station, having no more voice, and exercising
no more influence in business affairs, than a private individual.
It could not be expected that these churches,
after having experienced the benefits of their equal and
impartial government, would accede to the establishment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">{135}</a></span>
of any ecclesiastical organization that might tend to subvert
their independence, or to centralize in an extraneous
body the authority which was then disseminated through
and exercised by the members of the churches themselves.
Accordingly, we find that the right to choose, elect, and
ordain their own deacons was still retained by the churches,
as well as the privilege of specifying from their numbers
such candidates for the ministry as appeared eligible for
that sacred office, which specification and appointment,
being submitted to the Presbytery (a board of ministers
appointed for that purpose), by whom the qualifications,
talents, and character, of the candidate is examined, which
examination proving satisfactory, he is forthwith ordained
by the laying on of hands.</p>

<p>Neither has the Conference any right to institute a
judicial investigation of any difficulties that may arise
between individual members and the churches to which
they belong, nor to attempt any interference with dissensions
between sister churches, except by special and particular
invitation, and unless the subject has been previously
laid before the respective churches, and their delegates
to the Conference instructed to take cognizance of
the matter.</p>

<p>Such churches of the Sabbatarian order as desired admission
into this confederacy, were required to furnish a
written exposition of their doctrinal sentiments respecting
regeneration by the Holy Spirit, justification by faith, and
salvation through the merits of Jesus Christ, which, proving
satisfactory, the right hand of fellowship was extended
to their delegate on behalf of the Conference. Here we
may observe that this proceeding was not calculated nor
intended to establish any inquisitorial censorship of doctrinal
views, but to perpetuate good order, unanimity of
sentiment, and purity of faith.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">{136}</a></span>
At the time of the organization of the General Conference,
there were several churches of Seventh-day Baptists
who remained aloof from that confederacy. Of these,
one was situated in a very pleasant country, on the west
fork of the Monongahela River, in Harrison County, Virginia.
This church, in 1808, sent a letter to the Conference,
requesting admission into that body, but stating
their practice of receiving first-day members. In consequence
of this, their reception was postponed, and an
admonitory message upon the subject prepared and sent
to them. This church soon fell into a decline; its members
removed into other parts, and it finally became extinct.</p>

<p>With the exception of the minutes of the General Conference,
and one or two other works scarcely deserving of
consideration, the Seventh-day Baptists made no attempt
to form a denominational literature until 1820, when an
association of ministers edited and published a periodical
designated the Missionary Magazine. About the same
time a collection of hymns for the use of the denomination
was made, which met with very general acceptance and
applause. After the publication of the magazine had been
continued for two or three years, various causes contributed
to render the further prosecution of the enterprise inexpedient
and unadvisable. Upon the discontinuance of the
magazine, the necessity of a denominational literary organ
was very generally felt, but engagements in other pursuits,
fears of pecuniary losses, and other causes, operated to
prevent the enterprise until 1827, when Deacon John
Maxson, of Scott, projected and brought into successful
operation a weekly newspaper, called the Protestant Sentinel,
which, by untiring energy and perseverance, he succeeded
in supporting and publishing for several years.
The paper was first issued at Homer, then at Schenectady,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">{137}</a></span>
and finally at De Ruyter. To Deacon Maxson, the publication
of this paper appears to have been, from the first,
a losing concern. His engagement in the enterprise was
not undertaken with the view of expectation of pecuniary
profit. He was influenced by considerations far more
sacred and important. No doubt in the advantages secured
by that enterprise to his brethren he feels amply repaid
for all his toils and difficulties; for a man of his benevolent
heart and amiable disposition ever forgets all personal
considerations in the general good.</p>

<p>When the press was removed to De Ruyter, Deacon
Maxson resigned the editorial charge, which passed in a
very short period through several hands; the paper bearing
the name of The Seventh-day Baptist Register. Even
here its location was not considered as the most favourable,
and many supposed that the city of New York would
afford a more eligible situation. To that place, therefore,
in 1844, it was removed, and the Rev. George B. Utter
assumed the editorial chair, since which removal it has
borne the name of The Sabbath Recorder.</p>

<p>The denomination became early aware of the utility of
tract publications, and the General Conference in 1831,
recommended the formation of tract societies in the different
churches, which should become auxiliary to a general
tract executive committee, annually appointed by that
body, to procure, examine, and publish such tracts as in
their opinion might be desirable. In compliance with this
suggestion, such organizations were instituted in nearly all
the churches, and several tracts were procured and printed.
But the tract cause, like that of the denominational paper,
laboured under much discouragement and great embarrassment.
As a means for disseminating Christian truth and
knowledge, it does not seem, even yet, to be duly appreciated.
The want of available funds crippled its operations,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">{138}</a></span>
and lessened its usefulness; nevertheless it continued
to support a nominal existence until 1843, when it was remodelled
and reorganized under the name of the Sabbath
Tract Society, since which period its activity and usefulness
have been abundantly exhibited. It has a series of
stereotyped tracts, of which editions are published according
to the means and demands of the society. In connexion
with this, is a publishing society, recently organized, that
has issued several publications not connected with the
series, but all relating to the Sabbath controversy. The
denominational paper is also published under the auspices
of this society; and it is believed that whatever obstacles
may have impeded the progress of our publishing interests,
they are rapidly disappearing before the development of
our literary resources.</p>

<p>The utility of missionary organizations engaged, at a
very early period, the attention of the General Conference.
At this time it was the practice of the individual
churches to depute their ministers to make short journeys,
of which they generally defrayed the expense. The inefficiency
of this course had become painfully manifest, and
it remained for the Conference to devise some plan by
which the missionary efforts of the denomination could be
concentrated. The subject was under consideration for
two or three years, and finally resulted in the organization
of the Seventh-day Baptist Missionary Society. By reference
to the constitution of this society, which bears the date
of 1819, it appears that its object was to consolidate the funds
and concentrate the efforts of the denomination, in order to
promote the interests of religion by employing missionaries
and sending them to the destitute and scattered brethren
in our fellowship. This society, notwithstanding its laudable
object, was destined to meet with many difficulties and embarrassments.
The poverty of some of the churches, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">{139}</a></span>
the unwillingness of others to contribute, were serious obstacles
in the way of its accomplishment of the good it had
purposed to perform. Yet under its auspices, several missionaries
were annually appointed, for three, six, or nine
months, to occupy such fields of labour as appeared most
eligible, and generally embracing visitations to Sabbath-keepers
who were removed to distant localities. These
journeys, though attended in the sequel with the happiest
results, often required no small share of personal sacrifice
and inconvenience on the part of the performer. Difficulties
were always to be encountered; many times dangers.
These were greatly enhanced, from the fact that the missionary
field generally lay in some new region, where the
forests were as destitute of roads as the rivers of bridges, and
where the uniformity of the one might prove quite as perplexing
to the wanderer, as the swollen tides of the other
might render dangerous the unaccustomed ford. Not unfrequently
circumstances required the performance of these
journeys in the winter season, when every discomfort was
proportionately increased.</p>

<p>These missionaries held meetings, organized churches
where such a course seemed expedient, and administered
baptism to believers. Sometimes their visits to the destitute
would be attended by a gracious revival, but at all
times were accompanied with gratifying results. But the
embarrassments of the society continued, and finally, in
1841, it was formally extinguished, in order to make room
for another, whose regulations, it was conceived, were more
judicious, and which commenced operations in 1842. To
the domestic this adds a foreign field. Under its direction,
Messrs. Solomon Carpenter and Nathan Wardner, with
their wives, are labouring at Shanghai, in China, and the
mission, with which a small school, under the management
of the excellent Mrs. Wardner, is connected, is in a highly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">{140}</a></span>
flourishing condition. The Board are collecting funds to
build a chapel for public worship, to purchase an eligible
site for which, about one thousand dollars have been already
despatched to that country.</p>

<p>A Seventh-day Baptist society for the dissemination
of religious truth among the Jews, took a permanent form
in 1838, and Elder William B. Maxson was appointed to
labour, under its direction, with that ancient and bigoted
people. The success of this enterprise was not proportionate
to the anticipation indulged, although probably as
great as could have been expected, had all the difficulties
and obstacles of the mission been fully considered. In
connexion with this society, a small work on the prophetic
character of the Messiah was published, and many copies
gratuitously distributed among the Jews. Recently this
society has only supported a nominal existence.</p>

<p>The attention of the Seventh-day Baptists was early
called to the subject of education, and two institutions of
a high classical character, have been established among
them. Of these, one is located at Alfred, Alleghany
County, New York, and is denominated the Alfred Academy
and Teachers' Seminary; the other at De Ruyter,
New York, was founded in 1837, at an expense of near
thirty thousand dollars. The first has a charter from the
state, and both have acquired a high reputation, and
furnish the means of a classical education to a large number
of students. Besides these, academic schools have been
projected and brought into successful operation in other
sections, in connexion with our denomination.</p>

<p>The Sabbatarians have repeatedly taken action in their
ecclesiastical bodies, against war, intemperance, slavery,
secret societies, and the like, and in favour of the great
moral reforms and benevolent enterprises of the age.</p>

<p>Within the last twenty years a very interesting correspondence
has been carried on with the Sabbatarians of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">{141}</a></span>
England, through the medium of Rev. Robert Burnside,
and Rev. William Henry Black.</p>

<p>About 1830, the great increase of business, as well as
the scattered situation of the churches, seemed to justify, in
the opinion of many, some modification of a general annual
Conference. It was therefore proposed to divide the denomination
into two Conferences, according to their geographical
position. When the subject came up for action, it
was judged most expedient to continue the Conference, but
to divide the churches into Associations, which should
meet annually, to transact the business of the churches
within their own bounds, and appoint delegates to represent
them in the General Conference, which, according to
a resolution passed at one of its meetings, convened at
Shiloh, in 1846, is hereafter to meet triennially instead of
annually. Five Associations have been formed, in accordance
with this plan,—the Eastern, embracing the churches
in Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New Jersey,—the Central,
including those in the State of New York, east of the
small lakes,—the Western, composed of the churches in
Western New York and Pennsylvania,—the Southwestern,
comprising those in Ohio and Virginia,—and the Northwestern,
including those in Wisconsin and Iowa. The
utility of this arrangement is unquestionable, and, so far
as it has been tested, has been found to answer all the purposes
of an Annual Conference without its disadvantages.
But it must not be supposed that during all this time, the
sun of prosperity to this people has been unclouded; that
no difficulties have arisen in their straight and narrow path.
On the contrary, they have been subjected to many and
peculiar trials. They have been despised by the worldly
and the great, have been oppressed by law, and persecuted
in more ways than one by those professing the Christian
name. Even now they are subjected to many inconveniences
from their nonconformity, and are deprived of many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">{142}</a></span>
social and literary privileges that they might otherwise
enjoy. In consideration of this, and the strong worldly
tendencies that bind the human heart, it is not surprising
that thousands who have been brought up to recognise the
obligatory and sacred character of the fourth commandment,
and who were fully convinced of its unalterable
claims, have been induced to abandon it; while others, for
the same reasons, although fully convinced of their duty,
have refused to embrace it. Yet some have been able to
appreciate the vast importance of the stake at hand, have
felt the danger of trifling in an affair on which eternal
interests depended, and have concluded that popular
applause was nothing comparative with an approving conscience,
and the smiles of God. Such have strictly adhered
to the Sabbath, or have embraced it, notwithstanding the
consequences. Of the latter, we might instance several
eminent and worthy ministers, who now occupy prominent
places in the denomination. Rev. Wm. M. Jones,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_36" id="Ref_36" href="#Foot_36">[36]</a></span> and
Rev. J. W. Morton, Professor of Modern Languages in
the De Ruyter Institute, are both converts to Sabbatarianism.</p>

<p>In the history of Sabbath-keepers we have had a beautiful
exemplification of the truth of that promise, that he
who soweth in labour and with many tears, shall return
rejoicing, laden with the products of an abundant harvest.
Their numbers were few, their churches isolated, and their
opportunities for sharing in the emoluments of the world
both limited and unfrequent, nevertheless the dissemination
of their doctrines has become, through Divine Providence,
the means of reclaiming many wanderers to the Bible
Sabbath. The increase of the number of the Sabbath-keeping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">{143}</a></span>
churches may be attributed to a variety of causes.
Every society possesses within itself the principle of extension
and multiplication, by which it will ultimately quadruplicate
its numbers, when no counteracting agencies of
more potent influence are at work. In consequence of this,
the numerosity of a church sometimes became burdensome,
and it was considered necessary to establish a new fraternity
from the surplus members of the old. Emigration also became
a great source for the dissemination of the scriptural doctrine
of the Sabbath, as well as indicative of the ground
to be occupied by future churches. Thus some brother,
whom poverty or untoward circumstances had forced to
abandon his native state, and the Christian society of his
childhood, has been the pioneer of religious instruction to
the neighbourhood, and the honoured founder of a religious
establishment.</p>

<p>In the third place, the perceptions of many have been
enlightened by an unprejudiced perusal of the Holy Scriptures,
accompanied by the convincing energies of the Spirit
of truth. A venerable lady, resident in the State of New
York, embraced the Sabbath, to which she rigidly adhered,
notwithstanding the opposition and persecution of her
husband and kindred, although at the time unaware that
any denomination of Christian Sabbatarians existed. She
had obtained her knowledge of the Sabbath, its ordinance
and obligation, from the Bible alone. A gentleman of
Maryland, with his family, embraced the Sabbath without
having any previous communication or connexion with the
Sabbatarians; but the unprejudiced perusal of the Scriptures
had instructed him in the knowledge of his duty, and
he hesitated not in the performance of it. A multitude of
similar cases might be recorded; these, however, are sufficient
to show that Scripture testimony, when acting upon
unprejudiced minds, will invariably lead to a clear conviction
of the holy and sabbatical character of the seventh day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">{144}</a></span>
It is well known, that in nearly every State of the Union,
the observance of the first day is enforced by law. It is
certainly remarkable that these States, so distinguished for
their otherwise liberal and enlightened policy, should retain,
with such tenacity, this hateful feature in their legislative
system; thus subjecting to the alternative of conformity,
or to the liability of fines and imprisonment, a large and
respectable portion of the community. To obtain the redress
of these grievances, and the exemption from being
made amenable to civil processes served, or made returnable
upon the Sabbath, petitions were circulated for two or
three consecutive years, in the different States where the
Sabbatarians reside, and then presented to the consideration
of the legislative bodies. In no case, however, were
they attended with the results anticipated, either by a repeal
of the obnoxious statutes, or by the enactment of other
laws, more conformable to the spirit of the age.</p>

<p>Upon several occasions, the Seventh-day Baptists have
attempted to participate with their first-day brethren, in
Sabbath Conventions, and similar convocations. But, as
might have been expected, they have been uniformly excluded
from these deliberations; courteously, it is true, and
with expressions of Christian feeling and charity. In consequence
of this, they have instituted, and held, within
their own bounds, several Conventions and similar meetings,
designed to advance and disseminate the Bible doctrine
of the Sabbath.</p>

<div class="section">

 <h3 class="nobreak">SECTION II.<br />
 <small>EASTERN ASSOCIATION.</small></h3>

</div>

<p>The Eastern Association of Seventh-day Baptists, embraces
the churches located in Connecticut, Rhode Island,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">{145}</a></span>
and New Jersey. The history of these communities must
be highly interesting, and fraught with instruction to every
pious mind.</p>

 <h4>CHURCHES IN RHODE ISLAND.</h4>

<p>This little territory, which circumstances have rendered
so peculiarly dear and interesting to every pious mind, was
settled at a remarkable period in the history of the world,
and under circumstances not only new and peculiar, but
strongly adverse to former theories and practices. It remained
for the founder of this little colony to make the
discovery that the consciences of men were above the cognizance
of penal regulations or legal processes; but the
principles of religious freedom which he exposed and incorporated
in his government were regarded by all other
bodies, both civil, judicial, and ecclesiastical, as in the
highest degree visionary in theory, and dangerous, disorganizing,
and impracticable in real life.</p>

<p>It is not surprising that a pampered priesthood and
lordly prelates, whose honours and preferments were based
upon a system of ecclesiastical tyranny, should oppose, by
every possible means, the establishment of unlimited toleration;
although we may well wonder that those who had
felt themselves the heavy weight of religious persecution,
should commit so great an error, so palpable an inconsistency,
as to attempt to deprive others of the inestimable
blessing of worshipping God according to the dictates of
their own consciences. Roger Williams, who fled from the
persecuting Puritans, became the founder of the first Baptist
Church in America, which was instituted at Providence,
1644, and from which originated a church at Newport, in
1652, under the auspices of Rev. William Vaughan. From
this community seven persons seceded in 1671, and established
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">{146}</a></span>
the first Seventh-day Baptist, and the Third Baptist
Church upon the American continent. This secession
took place in consequence of the teachings of Stephen
Mumford, who emigrated from England in 1665, and who
contended, with zeal and fervour, for the perpetuity and
unchangeable nature of the Sabbatical ordinance. It is
greatly to be lamented that of the early life of this man,
the parent, under God, of so many flourishing religious
communities, so little is known.</p>

<p>Only a few facts have been preserved, and these rest on
questionable evidence. I have not been able to obtain any
knowledge of his parents, of the place of his birth and
education, or any of the circumstances connected with his
conversion. It is certain, however, that he embraced Sabbatarian
sentiments, or was educated in that belief in
Europe.</p>

<p>Mr. Mumford, when he arrived in this country, was in
the middle of life; a period when the energy of youth
remains without its rashness, and the mind is prepared to
act with steadiness without exhibiting the timidity and pertinacity
of old age.</p>

<p>It has been observed, with more beauty of expression than
either truth or consistency, that great circumstances make
great men. It is certain that extraordinary trials, new situations,
and difficult exigencies may and will develope unexpected
powers, and give prominence to certain traits of character;
nevertheless, the mind, in its essential qualities, generally
remains unchanged. Horace, whose knowledge of
human nature no one has ever distrusted, very pertinently
remarks, that those who cross the ocean pass under a new
sky, but do not change their disposition. This was undoubtedly
true of Mr. Mumford; and could we trace his
early history, we should doubtless find an exhibition of the
same principles and conduct which marked his subsequent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">{147}</a></span>
career. But the actions of Mumford speak loudly in his
behalf. He was evidently a lover of the truth, and one
neither ashamed nor afraid to advocate unpopular tenets
if they agreed with the Word of God. He cannot be
accused of bigotry or intolerant feelings towards those
who differed from him in sentiments, for he united with,
and continued in the communion of the First-day Baptist
Church in Newport for a considerable time. Neither does
it appear that he attempted to make proselytes by any
violent or injudicious methods, but simply showed the way
of right by expounding the Scriptures in friendly conversation.
It is evident that he had no ambition to be considered
as a partisan leader, for he never aspired to become
an elder even in the church which he had been instrumental
in gathering. While a conclusive testimony of his generally
irreproachable character, and the piety of his little
band of followers, is evinced by the fact that they were
not excluded from the First-day community, but voluntarily
withdrew from it, in consequence of the "hard
things" which were spoken against them by their brethren.</p>

<p>It is probable that Mr. Mumford was one of those amiable
and worthy characters, who, possessing an humble and unaspiring
disposition, never dream of worldly distinction or
popular applause, or that their actions, or the perpetuation
of their memories, can be beneficial or grateful to posterity.
At this time, too, the founder of a poor and despised sect
must have had other subjects of greater moment in mind,
and must have been too busy to record his own fortunes,
and too pious to feel any pride in recounting his ancestry,
his adventures, and his sufferings.</p>

<p>In the colony of Rhode Island liberty of conscience was
professedly established, and the friends of Roger Williams
have chanted his praise in no measured terms upon that
account; but how do their eulogies agree with the fact
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">{148}</a></span>
that even here the Sabbatarians were subjected to peculiar
troubles, and suffered much inconvenience, being exposed
to insults and annoyances upon their Sabbaths, and likewise
driven from their fields of labour upon the first day
of the week by the magistrate, although peaceably at work
in a manner that precluded any disturbance. Of the
manner of Mr. Mumford's death I have no account; but
"mark the perfect, and behold the upright, for the end of
that man is peace." Doubtless it was so with him.</p>

<h5>NEWPORT CHURCH.</h5>

<p>The Sabbatarian church at Newport was instituted in
1641. It then contained seven members, who had withdrawn
from the communion of the First-day church on
account of the differences subsisting between them with
respect to the Sabbatical ordinance. Their names were
Stephen Mumford, William Hiscox, Samuel Hubbard,
Roger Baster, and three sisters; William Hiscox became
their first pastor.</p>

<p>The early history of Elder Hiscox, like that of most of
his contemporaries, is wrapped in obscurity. He appears,
however, to have held an eminent place in the First-day
Baptist Church of Newport, then under the pastoral care
of Rev. Mr. Clark, as we find that he was appointed by
that body, in conjunction with Joseph Torrey and Samuel
Hubbard, to assist the Baptists at Boston, in a public dispute
concerning infant baptism, to which they were challenged
by the Puritan persecutors. This dispute was
actually held and continued for two days, though to little
purpose, for all turned out a farce so far as the Baptists
were concerned, who, as it appeared, were only invited
there to be tantalized and abused.</p>

<p>It is very probable that Mr. Hiscox had acquired a reputation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">{149}</a></span>
for public speaking before he was chosen or
ordained to the ministerial office by the infant church at
Newport. Be that as it may, his faithfulness, the prosperity
of the church under his ministry, and the successful
manner in which he vindicated the Scriptural tenets which
he had espoused, evinced the wisdom of their choice. He
fell asleep in Jesus in 1704, in the sixty-sixth year of his
age.</p>

<p>Rev. William Gibson, from London, where he received
his ordination, was his successor. Elder Gibson is said to
have descended from an ancient and highly respectable
family in Warwickshire. From his youth he was destined
for the church, and consequently he received a classical
education in Oxford, that nursery of ecclesiastics. While
prosecuting his preparatory studies, he accompanied his
fellow-students to see what they denominated "sport,"
which was, in reality, the public whipping of a poor woman
for nonconformity as it respected infant baptism, and the
religious observance of the first day. The great patience
and apparent piety of the victim, together with the brutality
of the sentence, wrought powerfully upon his sympathetic
mind, and finally he abandoned the study of logic for that
of the Bible, in order to discover what part of the sacred
volume authorized such proceedings. This inquiry, to the
inexpressible grief of his parents, who saw the prostration
of their worldly hopes, terminated in his conversion to
Baptist sentiments, and his emigration to America. He
filled the office of pastor to the church at Newport until his
death, which occurred in 1717, in the 79th year of his age.
Joseph Crandall, who had been his colleague for two years,
succeeded him. He was an able and worthy minister,
although illiterate, and the church prospered under his
administration. He died in 1737.</p>

<p>Rev. Joseph Maxson, another father in Israel, followed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">{150}</a></span>
who died in 1743. Mr. Maxson is said to have been extremely
apt and pointed in argument, but he was mainly
distinguished for judicious adaptation of means to ends in
all his intercourse with the unconverted. This will be
illustrated by the following anecdote. He had a neighbour
notorious for infidel principles and unchristian conduct, but
as such characters generally are, he was entirely ignorant
of the Bible, nor could he be prevailed on to read or accept
one. Mr. Maxson did not press the matter, but manifested
as much unconcern as he could assume. Some time after,
our infidel friend was returning home, when near his gate,
he discovered a book presenting the appearance of having
been accidentally dropped. He took it up; it was a Bible.
Upon the blank leaf was written—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">

<div class="verse indentqq">"'Twas for me, thy soul death tasted,</div>
<div class="verse">Seeking me, thy worn feet hasted;</div>
<div class="verse">Let such labour not be wasted."</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The exquisite beauty of this stanza struck the mind of
the scoffer; he thought that certainly his principles could
not be shaken by a slight examination of the book, as he
wished particularly to discover to what passage such beautiful
lines could apply. He did so; the result was his
conversion.</p>

<p>Rev. John Maxson, their next pastor, was a man of eminent
piety. He was not a proficient in the wisdom of this
world, but he possessed that without which all learning is
vain. He was eminently distinguished for his knowledge
and love of the Scriptures. He died in 1778.</p>

<p>Rev. William Bliss received the mantle of the ascending
Elijah. Mr. Bliss, in his early life, was much inclined to
deism, but when about thirty years of age, he became truly
serious, and finally he was happily converted, and united
in communion with the church. Soon after his public profession
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">{151}</a></span>
of religion, he became exercised on the subject of
the ministry. He had frequently improved his gift for
speaking, in the prayer and conference meetings; and he
received a public call of the church in 1773. In 1780, he
was installed pastor of the church, in which station he continued
during the remainder of his life, which was about
twenty-eight years.</p>

<p>Mr. Bliss was a warm and steady friend of his country,
and suffered much by the English soldiery, during the
Revolutionary war, being completely in their power while
the city of Newport remained in their possession. They
took possession of a part of his farm, on which they erected
forts, and a part of his dwelling, in which were quartered
many of their officers. They also cut down his orchards
to barricade the roads, and committed many depredations
of a similar character.</p>

<p>Mr. Bliss was the father of a large family, and some
very interesting circumstances are related of one of his
daughters. This young lady, when about sixteen years of
age, had a long and painful sickness, in which time she became
hopefully converted; and God was pleased to recommend
himself to her in a remarkable manner. During her illness,
at a time when she was very low, she lay for a long time
as one asleep, without sense or motion. Her attendants
looked upon her as dying; but presently she revived, and
was in the greatest transports of joy. She declared to
them that she had been favoured with a view of another
world, and had been conducted both to the mansions of
misery, and the abodes of felicity; and that in both places
she saw and recognised those with whom she had been
acquainted, and were then dead, but that she was forbidden
to tell them who were in misery; that she had water
given her to drink, which was inexpressibly sweet,—that
she was told that she would not recover from her sickness,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">{152}</a></span>
but must return for a season, and then that she should be
admitted back to stay for ever. She lived about a year
after this, during which time she looked forward with the
greatest pleasure to the time of her departure, and died in
full confidence that she should be immediately reconducted
to those scenes of felicity with which she had been made
acquainted.</p>

<p>As a minister of the gospel, Mr. Bliss was more distinguished
for logical and spiritual argumentation, than for
oratorical fervour. Few have excelled him in solidity of
judgment, and the happiest consequences uniformly resulted
from following his advice. As a Christian he was
remarkably exemplary, and adorned his profession in both
public and private life. He was warm and tender-hearted,
circumspect in his deportment, and always anxious to promote
the happiness and usefulness of all about him. He
was distinguished for a pleasant cheerfulness, which made
his conversation agreeable to persons of all ages.</p>

<p>The circumstances attending his death were quite remarkable.
For a few months previous to his decease, he
experienced several paralytic strokes, which, though light,
greatly reduced his physical strength. Still he retained
his mental faculties to the last, and was not confined to his
house but a few days. From this period he was sensible
that his departure was at hand, and he waited in the
greatest composure of mind for his approaching change.
For a few days before his death, he found his strength decaying,
but felt no other disease than a gradual loss of
physical power. The day before his death, he was visited
by his intimate friend, the Rev. Mr. Eady. To him, he
remarked, "I am going to try the truth of my doctrine."
The morning before he died, he was visited by a grandson
who had recently returned from Spain. With him he conversed
freely on the political and religious state of that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">{153}</a></span>
country. From these subjects, he referred to his own circumstances,
observing that he no longer possessed any
interest in the busy scenes of this world, as he was on the
point, he believed, of departing for a better one. He signified
that he thought himself to be dying, and appeared
animated with the prospect before him. He seemed like
Moses, who in his full strength, was permitted to ascend
the summit of Mount Pisgah, and thence view the fair and
fertile fields of the promised inheritance. Towards evening
he was visited by Deacon B., from Hopkinton, who called,
not intending to tarry through the night. He observed to
this gentleman that he was going to die, and thought he
would be needed about his person. He also made, with
great deliberation, further arrangements for calling assistance,
as he believed he should leave them before morning.
When Deacon B. retired to rest, he was walking the house
without exhibiting any unusual symptom except a strange
coldness of the hands and the feet. He had left him but a
short time when he heard an unusual stir below, and immediately
arose and repaired to his bedside; but his spirit had
fled. Thus closed his long and useful life on the 4th day
of May, 1808, in the 81st year of his age.</p>

<p>The Rev. Henry Burdick, was his successor, and
was assisted in the ministry by Rev. Arnold Bliss.
Both were young men of eminent piety and considerable
ability, and both continued to exercise their holy vocation,
until they were called to rest from their labours at a very
advanced age. Subsequent to the death of Elder Bliss,
which occurred in 1826, this church appeared to sink under
an accumulation of misfortunes and unpleasant influences.
This deplorable state of things continued for several years,
when the General Conference took into consideration the
utility of appointing a missionary to labour in that vicinity.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">{154}</a></span>
Accordingly, Lucius Crandall received an appointment to
that field, in which connexion he continued for three years.
He was succeeded in 1846 by Libbeus Cottrel, a young
man of considerable promise.</p>

<p>Besides this succession of pastors, the church at Newport
had several highly eminent men in its connexion.
Of these, the Wards were distinguished for holding high
official stations in connexion with the royal government of
the province. They were descended from an ancient and
highly respectable family in England, whose elder members
espousing the cause of the Parliament in the civil wars,
thereby became obnoxious to the dominant party at the
time of the Restoration. Mr. Thomas Ward, Esq., emigrated
to America, and joined the Sabbatarian church, of
which he continued a member until his death.</p>

<p>Richard Ward, his son, was one of those rare characters,
who, with talents and capacities fitted to adorn the highest
circles, are, nevertheless, not ashamed of godliness, or of
a consistent observance of the humble duties of religion.
He made a public profession of Christian faith, in 1753,
and uniting with this, then infant church, contributed
greatly by his talents, and wealth, and influence, to its
support. Determined likewise to give his brethren a solid
proof of his affection and regard he bequeathed five hundred
pounds sterling to the church at his death, which
occurred in 1766. This eminent man, as a citizen and
statesman, was distinguished for patriotism and philanthropy.
In his executive character as royal governor of
the province, he displayed a singular ability, and his
memory will long be remembered with affection and respect
by the people whom he served. Samuel Ward, his son,
was also governor in the years 1762 and 1765; the duties
of which office he administered with fidelity and zeal. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">{155}</a></span>
the years 1774 and 1775, he was a member of the Continental
Congress, in which difficult station all his conduct
was signalized by an inflexible integrity and unfailing
patriotism. As a man, a scholar, a statesman, and a
Christian, his character was equally respectable.</p>

<p>Mr. Henry Collins, another member of this church, was
pre-eminently distinguished in his time, being one of the
wealthiest citizens of Newport in the days of her colonial
glory, a munificent patron of the fine arts, and a highly
respectable literary character. He donated the ground
upon which the Redwood Library now stands, and was a
liberal contributor to all public enterprises of a benevolent
and useful character. Mr. Collins participated at all times
in the labours of his brethren with much zeal and great
effect; being always ready to act his part, sometimes as a
messenger to the other churches, and often at home in the
service of the congregation. In 1729, he was elected
Trustee, and with Mr. Jonathan Weeden had the sole
charge of erecting the house of worship. This venerable
structure stands upon a lot of land donated by Mr. Almy
to the church for that purpose. A rather singular anecdote
relative to this meeting-house is on record. During
the Revolutionary war, when Newport was occupied by
the British army, most of the meeting-houses in the town
were converted into barracks for the soldiers. The Seventh-day
meeting-house was also selected for this use, but when
the officer sent to take possession of it opened the door, he
discovered the ten commandments, which were written on
two tables representing marble, and placed over the pulpit.
Pausing a moment, he ordered his men to retire, remarking
that he could not spoil a house in which were written the
sacred laws of God. The meeting-house was accordingly
saved, although of but little use to the church during the
captivity of the town.</p>

<h5>FIRST SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, HOPKINTON,
RHODE ISLAND.</h5>

<p>This church was first organized in 1708, although
Seventh-day Baptists, in connexion with the church at
Newport, had resided here for a long period.</p>

<p>Rev. John Maxson, their first pastor, and one of the earliest
ancestors of the large and respectable family of that
name, was distinguished for great oratorical fervour and
pathos in public speaking, although he did not possess the
advantages to be derived from a classical education. His
voice is said to have been remarkably strong, clear, and
harmonious; his eye mild, blue, and beaming; his countenance
noble and expressive, and then he knew so well how
to touch the hearts of his auditory: always beginning his
discourses in a low and subdued tone, but warming with
his subject, and exhibiting throughout the general course
of his argumentation an air of vivacity and glowing energy;
and in his appeals, an ardour, pungency, and force altogether
irresistible. When addressing sinners, he would
weep from sympathy and feeling; but how would his countenance
irradiate and brighten when he told of a Saviour's
love! He died in 1720, in a ripe old age.</p>

<p>Rev. Joseph Clarke, who succeeded him, was ordained
in 1712, and exercised his ministry with great acceptance
until 1719, when he fell asleep in Jesus.</p>

<p>Rev. John Maxson, Jun., his successor, received ordination
in 1719, and continued his pastoral care over the
church, until 1747, when he went to receive his crown. It
is said that Elder Maxson possessed one gift most rare,
and at the same time most essential for a Christian minister.
This was great fervency and frequency in prayer. From
the closet he went to the pulpit, and he went from the
pulpit to the closet. He wrestled with the angel of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">{157}</a></span>
covenant like the patriarch of old, and like him he secured
a blessing.</p>

<p>Upon the death of Elder Maxson, the ministration of
Gospel ordinances in this church devolved on Elder Joseph
Maxson, of Newport, who served both churches until 1750.
Rev. Thomas Hiscox assumed at this time its pastoral
charge. He was a man of rare piety and eminent ability.
Evangelical in sentiment, eloquent in delivery, forcible and
pointed in argumentation, he was very successful as a
minister. Endowed with great conversational powers, a
pleasing and affable address, he was eminently qualified to
adorn the social circle, and no one could frequent his company
without being benefited by his piety and improved
by his wisdom.</p>

<p>He made a public profession of religion in early life,
and was even then distinguished for close application to
the study of the Scriptures. Contemning the vain and
fickle amusements of youth, he was ever found at the
prayer circle, and delighted particularly in solitude and
retirement. His maturity amply fulfilled the promise of
his spring, and the autumn of his days was accompanied
by an abundant harvest. He died in 1773, in the seventy-seventh
year of his age. Rev. Thomas Clarke, his colleague,
was appointed to the work of the ministry in 1750,
and departed this life in 1767, aged eighty-two years.
His death was eminently triumphant, and even after he
had ceased to speak, his pallid countenance shone with a
glory, and his glazing eye glowed with a rapture altogether
indescribable.</p>

<p>Rev. Joshua Clarke, son of the former, was eminently
distinguished, not only as a Christian minister, but as a
citizen. He sustained with fidelity and trust several
important town offices in the early part of his days, and
as a member of the corporation for the College at Providence;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">{158}</a></span>
was highly distinguished for classical and literary
taste, as well as the faithful discharge of the laborious and
varied duties pertaining to that station. His patriotism
and public spirit were continually exhibited during his
long and honourable service in the legislature of the state;
but it was chiefly in his position as a Christian minister,
that his gifts and graces were brought into action, and his
character displayed in all its beautiful and symmetrical
loveliness. For this station he was eminently fitted both
by nature and grace: a form lofty and commanding; eyes
deep and dark as midnight; voice clear and musical. His
preaching was powerful, and chiefly for this reason, it came
from the heart. The church, during his ministration, was
blessed with several revivals of religion. He travelled
many journeys on business connected with the church, but
finally rested from his labours in March, 1793, in the
seventy-seventh year of his age.</p>

<p>Rev. John Burdick, his successor, was equally distinguished
for eminent piety and natural ability. His discourses
were marked by a fervid, yet gracefully simple
eloquence. He was also eminent for faithfulness in discipline.
No member under his auspices was retained in the
church whose conduct or reputation could be a blot upon
her bright escutcheon; yet no one could accuse him of injustice
or partiality. His ministry was signally blessed
by a powerful revival, in which more than two hundred
persons were added to the church in one year. As a
citizen, he was liberal, public-spirited, and benevolent.
Incessant in his Gospel labours, he travelled much, visiting
destitute churches, many of which he had assisted in organizing.
He never received nor required a stated salary,
but wrought at the useful and healthful occupation of husbandry.
He was highly respected by other Christian denominations,
and maintained the most friendly intimacy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">{159}</a></span>
with their ministers. He died in the seventieth year of his
age, in 1802.</p>

<p>Rev. Abraham Coon, his successor, was ordained in
1798, and was very generally admired for solidity of judgment,
copiousness of thought, and eloquence of delivery.
He was frequently employed among other denominations
to their great satisfaction. He died in 1813.</p>

<p>Rev. Matthew Stillman, his colleague, was ordained in
1804, and continued his ministry with great acceptance
for nearly half a century. Elder Stillman, was a man of
moderate ability, but he possessed, in an eminent degree,
those excellencies of character and disposition, that are
far more desirable than brilliancy of wit, or depth and
variety of talent. Although others might be more admired,
none were more extensively and universally beloved. In
1819, Elders William B. Maxson, Daniel Coon, Thomas V.
Wells, and Amos R. Wells, are all reported as associated
with Elder Stillman in the ministry of this church. In 1832
Christopher Chester is reported as licentiate. He was
ordained in 1834, and continued in connexion with Elder
Stillman, to administer Gospel ordinances to this church,
until 1836, when Elder Coon became, for the second time,
a resident minister in the place. Subsequently he assumed
the pastoral relation in connexion with the church, which
situation he still occupies.</p>

<p>Beside these ministers, others have been ordained by
this church and that of Newport, who removed into other
parts, and became the founders of new fraternities. Of
these we may mention John Davis, of Burlington, Nathan
Rogers, of Berlin, and Ebenezer David, afterwards chaplain
in the American Army. Several members of this
church have risen to places of trust and importance in the
state. Their deacon, Daniel Babcock, held for a long
time, the office of Assistant Governor in the upper house of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">{160}</a></span>
the legislature. Others have been elected to fill offices of
responsibility in civil, judicial, and local affairs. As a
community, they are noted for wealth and intelligence, for
improvements in the useful arts, proficiency in scientific
pursuits, and steady industrious habits.</p>

<p>This community, notwithstanding the numerous amicable
dismissions that have been made from it to form other
churches, still remains one of the largest and wealthiest in
the connexion.</p>

<h5>SECOND SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, HOPKINTON,
RHODE ISLAND.</h5>

<p>This church, a branch of the former, was organized in
1835, and Amos R. Wells became its first pastor, in which
relation he continued for two years.</p>

<p>Rev. John Green assumed the pastoral charge in 1839,
which he held until 1846.</p>

<p>Rev. Lucius Crandall, his successor, remained two years,
and was succeeded by Rev. S. S. Griswold, the present
incumbent.</p>

<h5>THIRD SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, HOPKINTON,
RHODE ISLAND.</h5>

<p>This community, like the one last mentioned, is a branch
of the First Hopkinton Church, and seceded from the present
body in 1835. It may be observed, that previous to
this separation the Hopkinton Church became very numerous,
and built three meeting-houses for the accommodation
of the different neighbourhoods. These meeting-houses
are now occupied by the respective churches. This church,
however, remained in a rather low and depressed condition,
in consequence of being deprived of the services of a settled
pastor, until 1845, when Rev. A. B. Burdick assumed the
responsibility of that station. Rev. Charles M. Lewis, the
present incumbent, was installed in 1848.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">{161}</a></div>

<h5>SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, WESTERLY, RHODE ISLAND.</h5>

<p>This church was organized in 1837, and was served by
Henry Clarke as licentiate, and subsequently as pastor, for
several years.

Rev. Jacob Ayres, the present incumbent, was installed
in 1848. Elder Ayres, is the grandson of Rev. Jacob
Ayres of the Marlborough Church, and he seems to have
inherited Elisha's portion of the spirit and ability of his
venerable ancestor. He possesses, in an eminent degree,
one most rare and inestimable qualification for a gospel
minister,—a remarkable talent in prayer.</p>

<h5>SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, PAWCATUCK,
RHODE ISLAND.</h5>

<p>The distinct organization of this body took place in 1840,
and Rev. Alexander Campbell became its pastor, in which
connexion he remained until 1847.</p>

<p>Rev. Isaac More, his successor, was a convert to Sabbatarian
sentiments from the First-day Baptist denomination.</p>

<p>Rev. A. B. Burdick, the present pastor, was installed
in 1848.</p>

<h5>SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, RICHMOND,
RHODE ISLAND.</h5>

<p>This infant community was organized in 1843, and contains
about twenty members. Its prospects, however, are
highly encouraging, and it must be regarded as a very
auspicious omen, that Rev. John Green has consented to
assume the pastoral charge. Perhaps no one in the denomination
is better calculated to encourage the timid and
strengthen the weak.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">{162}</a></div>

<h5>SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, SOUTH KINGSTON,
RHODE ISLAND.</h5>

<p>This church, another infant community, was organized
in 1843. Elder Henry Clarke is their present pastor.</p>

<p>Rev. Christopher Chester has also been a very efficient
labourer in this region. His ministry has been blessed at
different seasons with the outpourings of the Spirit of grace,
and the hopeful conversion of many. This was particularly
the case in 1841, when a First-day Baptist church,
consisting of forty members, was gathered and organized
altogether through his instrumentality. In 1847, he visited
them again, and another revival was the consequence. In
this the Seventh-day church participated.</p>

<h4>EXTINCT CHURCH.</h4>

<p>A church was organized, in 1791, at Oyster Pond, on
Long Island, by Elisha Gillette, who came from New
Jersey, 1789.</p>

<p>But he soon began to admit members who observed the
first-day, in consequence of which intestine difficulties
arose. This church soon fell into decay, and ultimately
became extinct.</p>

<div class="section">

 <h3>SECTION III.<br />
 <small>SEVENTH-DAY BAPTISTS IN CONNECTICUT.</small></h3>

</div>

<p>In the first settlement of this country, Baptists were
persecuted by Pedobaptists, on account of their tenacity
for believer's baptism; but all parties were united in oppressing
and persecuting the Sabbatarians. Soon after
the organization of the church at Newport, the sentiment,
that the moral law was immutable and unchangeable, found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">{163}</a></span>
advocates in New London, Connecticut, where the spirit
of persecution was under less restraint than it was in
Rhode Island. There is an old work, which was written
by a Friend, and published in Baltimore in 1698, and
which gives a very detailed and circumstantial account of
the sufferings of the dissenting parties in New England.
According to his statement, no less than ten Sabbatarians
were mutilated, imprisoned, and subjected to barbarous and
cruel scourgings by their Puritanical brethren. Of these,
John Rodgers, a member of the church at Newport, but a
resident in New London, was fined, imprisoned, and sentenced
to sit a certain time upon the gallows with a rope
about his neck. Another, named Philip Rodney, who
was a Seventh-day Baptist in sentiments, although not a
member of the church, was scourged, and then deprived of
one of his ears. Sometimes their meetings would be disturbed
and broken up by the lawless violence of a mob.
At others they would be fined, imprisoned, and maltreated
for pursuing any ordinary business or labour upon the
first day of the week; and such was the opposition to
them, in many places, that a man who religiously observed
the Bible Sabbath, would much sooner be subjected to
fines and imprisonments, than if he had acknowledged it
to be the Sabbath. These hostilities against the observers
of the seventh-day, occasioned a remonstrance, addressed
to the Governor of New England, by Peter Chamberlain,
Senior Doctor of both Universities, and first elect Physician
in ordinary to His Majesty's person. This somewhat
abated the rage of persecution, although the Sabbatarians
were continually exposed to great inconveniences. It
does not appear, however, that any sect was ever extirpated
by persecution, particularly one that had the testimony
of Scripture upon its side, and flourished in an age
of general inquiry.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">{164}</a></div>

<h4>SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, BURLINGTON, CONNECTICUT.</h4>

<p>The distinct organization of this church took place in
1750, and Elder John Davis, who had been ordained at
Hopkinton, became their first pastor. The place was then
called Farmington, West Britain. This church, while yet
in its infancy, was considerably weakened by the loss and
removal of several of its most influential members. Other
difficulties arose of a peculiarly trying and painful character,
and few, if any, additions were made to their numbers
for more than ten years. But previous to the decease
of Elder Davis, which occurred in 1792, they were blessed
with a precious revival, and the church received several
additions. In the character of Elder Davis, we discover
few points that are brilliant or remarkable, but many that
are lovely and amiable. It is said, that he pre-eminently
exemplified the Christian duty of loving his neighbour.
His entire life exhibited a series of actions illustrative of
that virtue. The quiet placidity of his mien, his venerable
and dignified countenance, were long remembered with
enthusiastic veneration by the people of his charge. His
glory was not of this world—his name has never been
ranked with those of ecclesiastical dignitaries, scholars,
or civilians; but it was set in the Lamb's Book of Life—it
was known to angels, and the spirits of just men made
perfect.</p>

<p>Rev. Amos Burdick succeeded him in the pastoral care
of the church, in which station he continued until his death,
in 1803. The church, under his ministry, enjoyed great
prosperity and union. Rev. Amos Stillman, for some time
his colleague, was his successor. Elder Stillman, though
subject to many temporal embarrassments, was a preacher
of considerable ability and unblemished character; he was
universally esteemed. In the autumn of 1807, he visited the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">{165}</a></span>
churches in New Jersey, where the Conference was being
held, in which he presided and preached many times to great
satisfaction. But on his return home, he caught the yellow
fever, of which he died in 1807, in the forty-fifth year of
his age. From the loss occasioned by the death of Elder
Stillman, this church never recovered. A general declension
in religious feeling almost immediately followed, and
although meetings were regularly sustained a number of
years, and the name occurs in the Conference minutes,
it never after possessed that inestimable blessing, a stated
pastor. From 1810, its decline was gradual but sure, and
a few years since, it was publicly announced that the
Sabbatarian church at Burlington had ceased to exist.
Nevertheless, it must not be supposed that the Sabbatarians
of this community apostatized from their ancient
faith. Without a regular administration of gospel ordinances,
there could be few, if any, additions to their numbers.
Some of the old members were removed by death
to that home where congregations never break up, and
Sabbaths never end. Others have been the pioneers of
Sabbatical sentiments, and the founders of new churches,
in distant regions.</p>

<h4>SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, AT WATERFORD, CONNECTICUT.</h4>

<p>Soon after the organization of the Sabbatarian church
at Newport, we find that John Rogers of New London,
Connecticut, was fined and imprisoned, on account of his
adherence to Sabbatical sentiments. Others were subsequently
persecuted for the same cause; but they persisted
in their adherence to the truth, and ultimately became the
founders of a church at the place now called Waterford.
The church was organized in 1784, and Rev. Davis
Rogers became their first pastor. Their number was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">{166}</a></span>
sixteen; but soon after, several families emigrated from
Hopkinton and settled among them. In 1804, Elder
Rogers resigned the pastoral care of the church, and
removed to Preston, Chenango County. He was succeeded
by Rev. Jabez Beebe, whose ordination took place
in 1796, and whose ministry was very acceptable, though
not of a long duration.</p>

<p>Rev. Lester Rogers, his successor, was distinguished
for sobriety of mien, and although not calculated to shine
as the preacher of a promiscuous assembly, was very useful
and acceptable as a pastor of this church. He died in
1822.</p>

<p>Rev. Lester T. Rogers,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_37" id="Ref_37" href="#Foot_37">[37]</a></span> the present incumbent, was
licensed to preach in 1822, and ordained in 1824. Rev.
Benedict Wescott, for some time his colleague, was licensed
in 1828, and ordained in 1831.</p>

<div class="section">

 <h3>SECTION IV.<br />
 <small>CHURCHES IN NEW JERSEY.</small></h3>

</div>

<p>The churches in New Jersey are large and efficient
bodies, and date back to an early period in the history of
the state. They were distinguished in early times, and
when the denomination was in its infant state, for wealth
and respectability of character, and for pastors of eminent
piety and worth.</p>

<h4>SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, PISCATAWAY, NEW JERSEY.</h4>

<p>This fraternity, the third Sabbatarian Church in America,
was organized in 1705, and Rev. Edmund Dunham
became their first pastor.</p>

<p>Elder Dunham had been for some time a leader in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">{167}</a></span>
First-day Baptist Church at that place, and was moreover
extremely scrupulous in his observance of the first day.
This led him to reprove one Hezekiah Bonham, for attending,
upon that day, to secular concerns. Mr. Bonham
replied by requesting his censor to prove from Scripture
that the first day was holy by divine appointment. Upon
examination, Mr. Dunham not only discovered that his
point was untenable, but became in the end a zealous
advocate of the sacred character of the seventh day. In
a short time, the force of his arguments carried conviction
to the minds of seventeen others, who formed a church,
chose him for their pastor, and sent him to Rhode Island
to be ordained. He served the church until his death in
1734, and was succeeded by his son, Rev. Jonathan Dunham.
The talents of Elder Dunham were above mediocrity,
and although he had not been favoured with literary
advantages, his preaching was very effective, and he was
greatly beloved by his brethren. In the earlier part of
his ministry their first meeting-house was built, the church
having formerly met for worship in private houses. It
was erected upon a lot of one acre of land, which had
been donated to them for that purpose by Jonathan Fitz
Randolph. Elder Dunham, after serving this church upwards
of forty years, rested from his labours in 1777, in
the eighty-sixth year of his age. Rev. Jonathan Jarman,
for some time his colleague, was ordained in 1772, but
soon after removed to French Creek, in Pennsylvania.
Subsequent to the decease of Elder Dunham, this church
remained for several years without a pastor, but depended
for ministerial assistance upon the occasional visits of
travelling missionaries, or a precarious supply by first-day
brethren. The church also suffered much from being near
the seat of war, and in the vicinity of the ravages of the
British army.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">{168}</a></span>
Rev. Nathan Rogers, in 1786, assumed the pastoral
charge, and during that summer and autumn the church
was blessed with a remarkable revival of religion, in which
upwards of sixty were added to its numbers. During the
same year, Rev. Elisha Gillette received ordination as
evangelist, in connexion with this community, which relation
he sustained for three years.</p>

<p>Rev. Henry M. Lafferty, for three years the colleague
of Elder Rogers, was subsequently his successor in 1797,
and continued to occupy the pastoral office until 1811,
when he was succeeded by</p>

<p>Gideon Wooden, as licentiate, and subsequently as
pastor, who served the church until 1825, when he was
succeeded by</p>

<p>Rev. John Watson, whose ministry continued until
1840.</p>

<p>Rev. William B. Maxson, for eight years his colleague,
was for one year his successor, when</p>

<p>Rev. Walter B. Gillette, the present incumbent, was installed.
Besides these pastors, other ministers have, at
different times, been connected with this church, who have
removed to other fields of labour.</p>

<p>This church occupies a very pleasant situation, about
thirty miles from the city of New York.</p>

<h4>SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, PLAINFIELD, NEW JERSEY.</h4>

<p>This church, a branch of the former, was organized in
1838, and Lucius Crandall, first as licentiate and subsequently
as pastor, assumed the spiritual charge; in which
relation he still continues.</p>

<p>Both these churches are very wealthy and highly intelligent,
and occupy a distinguished position in the denomination.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">{169}</a></div>

<h4>SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, SHILOH, NEW JERSEY.</h4>

<p>This church dates to a very early period. So long ago
as 1695, an itinerant minister of the Seventh-day Baptist
persuasion, named Jonathan Davis, removed from Long
Island to the State of New Jersey, where he settled near
Trenton, and preached until his death, which occurred in
1750.</p>

<p>Elder Davis visited Cohansey, where his nephews resided,
one of whom, also named Jonathan Davis, was a
minister, and a principal agent in gathering this church,
which was constituted in 1737, and consisted of twenty
members, some of whom were emigrants from Piscataway.
Elder Davis continued to serve this church until his death,
in 1769. During his ministry their first meeting-house
was erected. It stands on a lot of one acre of ground,
which was donated to them by Mr. Caleb Ayars. The
burial-ground, as might be supposed, contains many time-honoured
monuments.</p>

<p>Rev. Jonathan Davis, his successor in the ministry, was
of Welsh extraction, and the son of Rev. David Davis, a
distinguished minister of the Welsh Tract Church. He was
born in 1734, received ordination in 1768, and installed as
pastor of the church upon the death of his predecessor, in
which relation he continued until his death in 1785. Elder
Davis was eminently distinguished for sound judgment,
great stability, and moral worth. He was universally
beloved, and the church, under his ministry, attained a
considerable degree of strength and permanence.</p>

<p>Rev. Jonathan Jarman, for some time his colleague, removed
to Cape May, where he died, but his remains were
subsequently brought back to Shiloh for interment.</p>

<p>Deacon Philip Ayars was likewise considered a leader
in this church, and an administrator of baptism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">{170}</a></span>
Rev. Nathan Ayars was ordained in this church in 1786,
and remained its pastor until 1810.</p>

<p>Rev. John Davis, youngest son of Elder Jonathan Davis,
was for several years his colleague, and finally his successor.
Elder Davis was ordained in 1807, and continued
to serve the church until 1842, when, overcome with age
and infirmity, he resigned the pastoral charge to</p>

<p>Rev. Azor Estee, who was succeeded in 1844 by</p>

<p>Rev. Solomon Carpenter, whose transfer to the China
Mission left the church without a pastor. However, in the
latter part of 1845 they secured the services of</p>

<p>Rev. Samuel Davison, a convert to the Sabbath, and a
very able preacher, who remained for about two years,
and was succeeded by</p>

<p>Rev. Giles M. Langworthy, whose illness and premature
death left them again in a destitute condition.</p>

<p>During the past summer the church was served by
Rev. Enoch Barnes, a very worthy man, and a convert to
Sabbatarianism from the Methodist connexion.</p>

<p>Rev. George R. Wheeler is also a member of this church,
but he resides at Salem, about ten miles distant. Mr.
Wheeler and family were likewise converts to Sabbatical
sentiments.</p>

<p>This church has been blessed with many auspicious
revivals. One took place in 1807, and continued for a
long time. It was very extensive, and about seventy were
added to the church. Subsequently many precious seasons
were enjoyed, but perhaps the greatest in-gathering occurred
in the commencement of the year 1843, when about
ninety were added to the church. This gracious visitation
of the Holy Spirit commenced and continued through a
meeting of days, in which Elder John Green and Elder
Estee were the leaders. It was marked at first by a deep
and unusual seriousness in the congregation, that gradually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">{171}</a></span>
increased, and seemed to pervade every heart in the
vast assembly. Meetings for prayer and religious inquiry
succeeded, at which old and young attended, whose countenances
were indicative of the various emotions of their
souls. Some in a fixedness of look that seemed to say,
"God and eternity are near;" some with a settled gloom
and depression of countenance; some with marks of indescribable
anguish; and some with the holiest and happiest
serenity, placid and beautiful as the loveliest sky after a
storm.</p>

<p>Sabbath after Sabbath scores of candidates of all ranks
and ages, from the child of ten summers to the old man
of seventy winters, came together requesting the ordinance
of baptism, and what was most remarkable, the greatest
order and propriety prevailed. There were no exhibitions
of enthusiasm, no rapturous outbursts, or passionate exclamations.
All was calm, sedate, and tranquil. Every one
seemed to be impressed with a sense of the indescribable
holiness of God, and the sinfulness of the human heart.
Every one seemed to feel himself within the most holy
place. There was confession, thanksgiving, and entreaty,—so
humble, and yet so confiding,—so confiding, and
yet so presumptuous,—so importunate, and yet so submissive.
There were songs of praise and sighs of penitence.
There were tears of holy joy, of exalted hope, of remorseful
sorrow. From this church the sacred excitement extended
to others, and many precious revivals occurred in
the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>This community is at present engaged in building a new
meeting-house, at a cost of five thousand dollars, having
donated the old one to a school and society formed for
educational and agricultural purposes.</p>

<p>This church was for a long time concerned in a very
tedious affair relative to a lot of land in Philadelphia,
which had been left by the will of Richard Sparks to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">{172}</a></span>
Seventh-day Baptists for a burial-ground. The date of
the will I have been unable to obtain, but it appears that
Sparks was one of the Keithian Seventh-day Baptists;
that he was baptized by William Davis, in 1699; and that
he belonged to a church of our persuasion in Newtown,
Chester County. He was a man of large property, and
being determined to give his brethren some substantial
proof of his regard, donated to them the before-mentioned
lot, which, at that time was in the suburbs of the city,
although at present it is nearly in the centre. It was
used, for some time, as the burial-ground of the church,
and upon a marble slab, placed in the wall by which it is
surrounded, are inscribed the names of those who are
interred within. Subsequent to the extinction of that
church, and the removal of its members, many of whom
emigrated to Shiloh,<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_38" id="Ref_38" href="#Foot_38">[38]</a></span> it became a question whether the disposal
of this property might not be effected, and the proceeds
of the sale appropriated by the General Conference.
Pursuant to this design, Caleb Shepherd, of Shiloh, was
appointed as agent for the sale of said lot, with instructions
to present a memorial to the Legislature of Pennsylvania,
petitioning them to authorize its disposal for
pecuniary compensation, or in exchange for other land
more conveniently situated. But these tedious negotiations
resulted in a manner the most unsatisfactory. The Legislature
decided that according to the tenure of the will, their
only right to it was founded upon their using it for burial
purposes; and that therefore there could be no legal disposal
made of it.</p>

<p>About this time the Conference, in its denominational
capacity, withdrew all claim to it in favour of the Shiloh
and Piscataway churches. Subsequently it was leased to
a hose company; and afterwards sold by these churches to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">{173}</a></span>
Stephen Girard, by whom it was conveyed to the corporation
of the city of Philadelphia, in whose possession it still
continues.</p>

<h4>SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, MARLBOROUGH, NEW JERSEY.</h4>

<p>This church, a branch of the former, was organized in
1811, and Rev. Jacob Ayras became its pastor, in which
relation he continued until his death, in 1838, having
served the church nearly twenty-five years.</p>

<p>Rev. Samuel Davis, brother of Elder John Davis, of
Shiloh, was for some time his colleague in the ministry.</p>

<p>Rev. David Clawson, his successor, was returned as
licentiate in connexion with the church at Piscataway, in
1833; was ordained in 1836, and installed as pastor of
this church in 1839, in which relation he still continues.</p>

<h4>OBSERVATIONS.</h4>

<p>It will be perceived that this Association embraces the
oldest churches, and is emphatically the stronghold of
Sabbatarianism. Most of them also have originated from
ordinary causes. Those of Piscataway and Shiloh have
each produced a branch. Three of those in Rhode Island
originated from a remarkable revival, which progressed in
1837, under the ministrations of Elder John Green, in
which sinners were converted to God by hundreds. All
the older churches have been the seats of stated pastors;
consequently they escaped, at least in former times, all
the evils to be apprehended from frequent changes. These
pastors, also, however deficient they might appear in the
graces of elegant diction, were distinguished for sound
reasoning and plain sense. Their zeal was tempered with
moderation; their piety with rationality. If not very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">{174}</a></span>
scrupulous as to method and language, they were correct
in their views, and orthodox in their principles. The
themes of their discourses were the doctrines of the Gospel,
and the nature of experimental religion, which they explained
in a manner adapted to the capacities of their
hearers. That much of this old-fashioned system is being
done away with, is evident to the most casual observation.
This profitable mode of preaching has been exchanged for
one disposed to harp on opinions and debatable points.
But, although a deep explication of mysterious subjects
may look more wise, and excite, for the moment, more
interest than to travel on in the old track, the tampering
with matters beyond knowledge, to the neglect of plain but
edifying subjects, will be attended by a general dearth of
religious feeling.</p>

<div class="section">

<h3>SECTION V.<br />
<small>CENTRAL ASSOCIATION.</small></h3>

</div>

<p>This body embraces all those large and respectable
churches which are situated in the State of New York, east
of the small lakes. Most of this great body of our denomination
have been collected here within half a century.
About ninety years ago, we first find traces of Sabbatarian
sentiments in this extensive country. Since that period
the dissemination of this scriptural truth has been slow but
sure. Churches have one after another been constituted,
which, taken as a whole, have occupied an important position,
not only as to location, but likewise as to the tone of
feeling which they have given to the efforts and enterprises
of the denomination in benevolent and educational pursuits.
They were among the earliest promoters of Domestic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">{175}</a></span>
Missions in the then destitute regions of their own and
the Southwestern States. By their unwearied and active
exertions, amid all the discouragements incident to poverty,
limited means, and untoward circumstances, evangelists
were sent out to disseminate the truth in those then destitute
places, where, for many years past, flourishing churches
and powerful auxiliaries have existed. They seem also to
have first become interested in the subject of Sabbath
schools, conference meetings, and monthly concerts for
prayer. Their anniversaries are held at different places
in their long range of territory, and so commodious
and expeditious is the modern mode of travelling, that
although the churches are spread along a distance of two
or three hundred miles, yet the labour of attending them
is but small, and more than repaid by witnessing the varied
and beautiful scenery along the route. The very flourishing
institution denominated the De Ruyter Institute, is
located within the limits of this Association. It is situated,
as its name imports, in the pleasant village of De Ruyter,
on the southwestern part of the county of Madison. It was
projected in 1835, and went into operation in 1837. The
building is of stone, ninety-four feet front, and sixty-four
in width, including the depth of the wings projecting backwards.
It contains a chapel, a room for philosophic lectures,
one for the library and society for natural history, six recitation
rooms, and fifty-six students' rooms.</p>

<p>There is both a male and female department in the institution;
and the faculty, by their ability and assiduity,
have commended it to the good opinion of the public, among
whom it has hitherto sustained a high reputation.</p>

<h4>SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, BERLIN, NEW YORK.</h4>

<p>This church, the oldest body in this Association, was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">{176}</a></span>
organized in 1783, although many years previous, a number
of Sabbath-keepers, principally members of the Sabbatarian
churches in Rhode Island, had removed into these
parts, being among the first settlers of the place. Of
these, the large and respectable families of the Coons,
Greenmans, Crandalls, Greens, and Randalls, were most
distinguished for enterprise and intelligence. They occupied
a very pleasant situation in the northeasterly parts of
the State of New York, adjoining Massachusetts. The
place was first called Little Hoosack, and the Sabbatarians
resided in the towns of Berlin, Petersburg, and Stephentown,
in which branch churches have since been established.</p>

<p>After the organization of the church, Rev. William Coon,
from Hopkinton, became their first pastor. Elder Coon
was a man of great natural ability, and was so pre-eminently
blessed in his ministry, that nearly two hundred
persons were added to the church in one year. He died
in 1801. He was highly esteemed by Mr. Van Rensselaer,
then deputy governor of the state, who bestowed upon him
a valuable farm, and contributed liberally towards defraying
the expenses of their new meeting-house.</p>

<p>Rev. Asa Coon, his nephew and successor, officiated in
the ministry but a few months, when he was removed by
death.</p>

<p>Rev. William Satterlee received ordination in 1805, in
the thirty-seventh year of his age, and was immediately
installed as pastor of the church, in which relation he still
continues. Elder Satterlee has been emphatically a father
in Israel. Thousands have walked in more brilliant paths,
have risen to loftier stations, and acquired more extensive
renown, but perhaps no one has been more really useful as
a Christian minister. In his family, in the church, in the
conference, he was equally amiable, equally attentive to
the desires of others, and equally anxious to do good.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">{177}</a></span>
While others pursued the phantom of popularity, Elder
Satterlee remained content with the applause of his own
conscience, and his brethren were so well aware of his
ability and paternal character, that for many years he
was unanimously chosen Moderator of the General Conference.</p>

<p>Under his ministry the church became another mother
of churches, and nursery of ministers, besides producing
several eminent characters.</p>

<p>Rev. James H. Cochran was installed as assistant pastor
in 1849.</p>

<h4>SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, PETERSBURG, NEW YORK.</h4>

<p>This community, a branch of the Berlin Church, was
organized in 1829, but remained until 1835 without a
pastor, when Bethuel C. Church became a licentiate in
their connexion, where he continued for one year.</p>

<p>Rev. Azor Estee, his successor, was licensed in 1836,
and received ordination in the autumn of the same year.
In 1841, he resigned the pastoral charge of this church to
Jared Kenyon, who continued in its service as licentiate
until 1844, when Elder Estee returned to them again.</p>

<p>Rev. William B. Maxson was resident here in 1845.</p>

<p>Rev. James Summerbell was ordained, pursuant to the
request of this church, in 1849, and was immediately installed
as pastor.</p>

<h4>SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, NEW YORK CITY.</h4>

<p>This church was organized in 1845, although Sabbatarians
had resided in Brooklyn and its vicinity for a long
time previous. They have a large and commodious meeting-house.
Rev. T. B. Brown is their present pastor.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">{178}</a></div>

<h4>SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, ADAMS, JEFFERSON
COUNTY, NEW YORK.</h4>

<p>This church was organized in 1822, and Rev. William
Green became its first pastor, which relation he sustained
with great acceptance until 1841, when</p>

<p>Rev. Eli S. Bailey assumed the pastoral charge for one
year, and was succeeded by</p>

<p>Rev. Joel Green, who, in 1845, resigned his station to
Rev. G. M. Langworthy.</p>

<p>Rev. Alexander Campbell is the present incumbent.</p>

<p>This church has been blessed with several revivals of
religion, and is a very efficient community. Unlike some
of its sister churches, it has always been in a sound and
healthy condition, and at present holds a high rank among
the most decided friends of all the principles and institutions
of the denomination.</p>

<h4>FIRST SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, BROOKFIELD,
NEW YORK.</h4>

<p>As early as 1791, several members of the Hopkinton
Church emigrated to this place and began a settlement.
The country at that time was wild and uninhabited. Hills
and valleys were covered with forests in all their primeval
majesty, through which the wild deer and the Indian
roamed. But the hand of industry soon wrought a wonderful
transformation in this now beautiful country. The
woods disappeared. Green pastures and yellow harvests
waved in the valleys. The hills were crowned with cottages,
homely, indeed, but delightful, for they were the abodes
of piety and content. There was temporal comfort and
prosperity. There was spiritual happiness and godly hope.
The Sabbath was neither forgotten nor neglected. It was
linked with too many hallowed memories, too many sweet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">{179}</a></span>
and pleasant associations, too many blessed reminiscences
of home, of kindred, of heaven, ever to be deserted by
those who were exiled by the force of circumstances from
the delightful scenes of their youth. Meetings were instituted,
and continued from house to house, and many
precious seasons were enjoyed before the organization of
the church.</p>

<p>In the autumn of 1797, they were visited by Elders
Burdick and Coon, of Hopkinton, and by them constituted
a church in sister relation. They numbered at first but
twenty members.</p>

<p>Rev. Henry Clarke became their first pastor, in which
relation he continued until 1829.</p>

<p>Rev. Eli S. Bailey received ordination in 1819, and the
same year became associated with Elder Clarke in the
ministry.</p>

<p>Rev. Daniel Coon removed from Hopkinton the same
year, and became a resident in connexion with this church.</p>

<p>Rev. William B. Maxson assumed the pastoral relation
as assistant of Elder Clarke, in 1823, and remained until
1833.</p>

<p>Rev. John Green, his successor, continued four years,
and was succeeded by</p>

<p>Rev. Sebeus M. Burdick, who, in 1841, resigned the
office to</p>

<p>Rev. William B. Maxson, who remained for two or three
years, and was succeeded by</p>

<p>Rev. O. P. Hull, for a short period, when Elder Maxson,
the present incumbent, was again installed.</p>

<p>Several licentiates have, at different times, been connected
with this church. Of these we may mention Charles
Card, in 1832, and more recently, Charles M. Lewis,
Waitstill Phillips, and David Burdick.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">{180}</a></div>

<h4>SECOND SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, BROOKFIELD,
NEW YORK.</h4>

<p>This community, a branch of the First Brookfield Church,
was organized in 1823, and Eli S. Bailey became its first
pastor. Under his ministry the church enjoyed several of
those auspicious seasons denominated revivals of religion,
and continued many years in a state of general peace and
prosperity. Elder Bailey was educated for the medical
profession, which he pursued for some time with eminent
success. At this period neither his habits of life nor associations
gave promise of his ever becoming a Christian
minister; but, notwithstanding that his profession was one
of honour, and opened before him a fair path to wealth and
eminence, his heart turned towards the task of winning
souls to God. In 1839, James Bailey was associated as
licentiate, and subsequently as elder, in the ministry of
this church. Rev. Samuel B. Crandall succeeded in 1842,
and continued for one year, when Elder Bailey again
assumed the spiritual charge, which he continues to
exercise.</p>

<h4>THIRD SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, BROOKFIELD,
NEW YORK.</h4>

<p>This church, like the former, originated from the First
Brookfield Church, and was also organized in 1823.</p>

<p>Rev. Daniel Coon became its first pastor, in which relation
he continued until 1836.</p>

<p>Rev. Samuel B. Crandall, his successor, and the present
incumbent was licensed in 1831, and ordained in 1832,
since which period, with the exception of one year, he has
been connected with this church.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_39" id="Ref_39" href="#Foot_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">{181}</a></div>

<h4>SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, TRUXTON, NEW
YORK.</h4>

<p>Originally, this church was composed of emigrant members
from the First Brookfield Church. Its distinct organization
took place in 1824. In 1826 it became the seat of
Rev. Alexander Campbell, who remained until 1833.</p>

<p>Rev. Zuriel Campbell, his successor, was licensed in 1835,
and ordained in 1838. Subsequent to his removal, which
took place in 1839,</p>

<p>Rev. Russell G. Burdick, assumed the spiritual care for
one year. He was followed by Elias Rogers as licentiate,
who, in 1844, was succeeded by Solomon Coon, and Varnum
Burdick, in the same capacity. Varnum Burdick is
the present incumbent.</p>

<h4>SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, DIANA, LEWIS COUNTY,
NEW YORK.</h4>

<p>This church originated from a small company of Sabbatarians
who removed from Brookfield, several years ago,
and who, although deprived of sabbatical and sanctuary
privileges, nevertheless maintained prayer and conference
meetings, and exhibited in their daily walk and conversation
an exact conformity to their holy vocation. Recently
several influential and highly respectable families in this
vicinity have embraced the Sabbath, and in 1846, a church
was organized consisting of sixteen members, with prospects
of large additions at an early period. It is supplied
with ministerial assistance by the Missionary Society.</p>

<h4>SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, DE RUYTER,
NEW YORK.</h4>

<p>This church, originally composed of emigrants from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">{182}</a></span>
Berlin and Hopkinton communities, was constituted in
1806. David Davis became their first, pastor.</p>

<p>Rev. John Green, his successor, was ordained to the
work of the ministry in 1819. A well-written biography
of Elder Green would be most edifying, as perhaps no
other minister in the denomination has been the leader in
so many auspicious revivals. In numerous instances, his
visitations to the churches have been accompanied with
the most remarkable outpourings of the Spirit of grace.
Indeed, so often has this been the case, that long since it
became proverbial among the people, and a promised visit
from Elder John Green was considered as the sure precursor
of a reformation. It is no wonder, therefore, that
this venerated man is, with few exceptions, so universally
beloved and respected, for multitudes look up to, and
regard him as their spiritual father. It is no wonder that
the aspersions of malice, and the machinations of envy
have been unable to destroy his credit or his influence with
the denomination at large. Yet this man, who has received
so many seals to his ministry, and whose presence to the
churches is so auspicious, is a plain old-fashioned man,
neither skilled in logic nor taught in the schools. He has
none of the polish or blandishments of modern eloquence,
no affectation of learning, no parade of jingling phrases or
high-sounding words.</p>

<p>O how many of our young men, who discourse learnedly
of preparatory studies for the ministry, might, with infinite
advantage, sit at the feet and learn of this Shamgar in
the churches, who, coming from the fields of honest industry
to the pulpit, has been more instrumental in winning souls
to God, than most of the scholars who have come to the
contest elate with the honours of a full collegiate course.
Like a certain remarkably effective preacher of old, who
came into the ministry with hands undried from the fisherman's
net, or like another, of some account at one time in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">{183}</a></span>
the churches, who wrought at a useful occupation that he
might not be burdensome to any, Elder Green was undoubtedly
called and set apart as a chosen vessel, by the Spirit
of truth. What weeping sinner, what returning backslider,
ever thought or inquired whether he was skilled in algebraic
problems, Hebrew nouns, or Greek verbs? Learning
to such a preacher would not and could not be any help;
it might be a hindrance. It might lead him to trust in
earthly availments, and make him forget in what his great
strength lay. Have we not reason to fear that a vain
trust in learning and temporal advantages is the Delilah
that has shorn the locks from so many spiritual Samsons,
and rendered them powerless before their enemies? It
would be a difficult matter to attempt an analyzation of
the sermons of Elder Green, or to show in what the secret
of his success consisted. No one, while listening to his
discourses, would think of applying to them the ordinary
tests of criticism; indeed, no one would be half so much
pleased with the speaker as displeased with himself. He
would probably forget the time, the place, and the congregation,
and see himself transported at once to the bar of
God, with the world in flames. His cogitations would not
be, "Oh, what a learned and beautiful discourse!" but
"Oh, wretched man that I am!" or, "Oh, blessed Jesus,
how wonderful is thy love and goodness!" Yet in these
sermons, so remarkably effective, there does not appear
the least striving for effect, no attempt to enlist the
passions of the auditory, no forced and laboured ejaculations;
but the attention is first engaged by the voice, the
look, the manner, the appearance of the speaker; our
interest increases with his amplification of the subject, and
his application of it every one that hears must feel.</p>

<p>Elder Green remained at De Ruyter until 1826, when
the church was for some time without a pastor.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">{184}</a></div>

<p>Rev. Alexander Campbell, his successor, was installed
in 1834, and remained for several years.</p>

<p>Rev. James Bailey succeeded him in 1842, and remained
until 1848.</p>

<p>Rev. James R. Irish, Principal of the De Ruyter Institute,
is the present incumbent.</p>

<p>Many licentiates, in connexion with the Literary Institution,
have at different times officiated in this church.</p>

<h4>SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, HOUNSFIELD,
JEFFERSON COUNTY, NEW YORK.</h4>

<p>This church originated from the Seventh-day Society in
Adams, and was constituted in 1841, William Green
assuming the pastoral charge, in which relation he still
continues.</p>

<p>The services of a settled pastor are, to these infant
churches, of inestimable value.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_40" id="Ref_40" href="#Foot_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<h4>SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, LINCKLAIN, CHENANGO
COUNTY, NEW YORK.</h4>

<p>This church was organized in 1831, and Sebeus M.
Burdick became its spiritual guide.</p>

<p>In 1839, G. M. Langworthy and Thomas E. Babcock
were returned as licentiates in its connexion, but Elder
Burdick, in 1842, assumed its parochial charge for the
second time. He was succeeded, in 1846, by the Rev.
Joshua Clarke.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">{185}</a></div>

<p>At present it is supplied with ministerial assistance by
the brethren at De Ruyter, of the church in which place
it is a branch.</p>

<h4>SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, OTSELIC, CHENANGO
COUNTY, NEW YORK.</h4>

<p>This church was organized in 1830, and Ephraim Curtiss
became its pastor. Elder Curtiss was a man of distinguished
merit and great promise. His talents and services
were of inestimable value to this infant community; but
the Great Head of the church was pleased, for wise but unseen
purposes, to remove him from earth while yet in the
noon of his days. His decease, combined with other causes,
has contributed to keep this church in a backward state.
For a long time their harps were hung upon the willows,
and although they remained inflexible in their attachment
to the great distinctive principles of the denomination, and
supported sabbatical ordinances in a regular manner, they
have been blessed with few additions to their numbers.</p>

<p>Rev. Joshua Clarke, their present pastor, was installed
in 1847.</p>

<h4>SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, PRESTON, CHENANGO
COUNTY, NEW YORK.</h4>

<p>This church dates back to a very early period. In 1804,
Davis Rogers, who had been ordained in 1784, with several
members of the Waterford (Connecticut) Church, emigrated
to this place, where they organized a church, which, under
his ministry, continued for a long time in a flourishing
condition. In 1818, it was admitted into the Conference,
at which period David Davis was associated with Elder
Rogers in the ministry. The death of Elder Rogers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">{186}</a></span>
which, as I am informed, occurred about 1832, left this
weak and sickly community in peculiarly trying and painful
circumstances, and the members became scattered like
sheep without a shepherd. Subsequently they were gathered
and the church reorganized by Elder Benedict
Wescott, of Waterford, in 1834. This worthy and useful
man then assumed the spiritual charge of the scattered
flock, in which relation he continued until 1842.</p>

<p>Rev. Varnum Hull, his successor, was ordained in 1843,
and continued to serve this church for four or five years.</p>

<p>Rev. Joshua Clarke, the present incumbent, is connected
both with this and the Sabbatarian community at Otselic.</p>

<h4>SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, RICHLAND, OSWEGO
COUNTY, NEW YORK.</h4>

<p>This infant community was gathered and organized in
1845. Though few in number, they give promise of great
efficiency.</p>

<p>Rev. Elias Burdick is their pastor.</p>

<h4>SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, SCOTT, CORTLAND
COUNTY, NEW YORK.</h4>

<p>This church was originally composed of members from
the Berlin and Rhode Island Churches. Of these we may
notice the large and respectable families of the Burdicks,
Babcocks, and Hubbards, who, even to this day, are the
bone and sinew of the Scott fraternity. It was organized
in 1820, and William B. Maxson became its first pastor,
and Holly Maxson the first deacon. It is justly due to
the memory of this venerable man to remark, that for
piety, disinterested benevolence, and every amiable and
Christian grace, he has rarely been equalled and never
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">{187}</a></span>
excelled. Mild and equable in disposition, complacent and
affable in manner, he was particularly qualified to soften
animosities and settle difficulties; while the uniform estimation
in which he was held, and the known impartiality
of his decisions, caused him to be chosen as umpire and
arbitrator in all disturbances and divisions of whatever
kind. His memory is still venerated, and the most honourable
testimonies to his merit are yet borne by the community
where he resided. His death was in character with
his life. He died repeating</p>

<div class="verse indentq">"Jesus can make a dying bed</div>
<div class="verse">Feel soft as downy pillars are."</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Rev. Joel Green was licensed in 1823, and ordained,
agreeably to the request of this church, in 1824, in which
connexion he continued until 1840.</p>

<p>Rev. Job Tyler, for a long time his colleague, was also
licensed in 1823, and received ordination in 1825.</p>

<p>Rev. Orson Campbell, of Berlin, assumed the spiritual
guidance of this church, in connexion with and during the
prolonged absence of Elder Green, in 1838 and 1839.</p>

<p>Rev. Russell G. Burdick, the present incumbent, succeeded
to the parochial care of this church in 1842.</p>

<p>This church has been blessed with several powerful and
extensive revivals, and twice to my remembrance these
auspicious seasons occurred during the visitations of Elder
John Green. These religious excitements were generally
attended with extraordinary exhibitions. Sometimes nearly
every individual in the congregation would be prostrate
upon their knees, while a mingled utterance of screams,
wailings, prayers, notes of grief and joy, would rise in one
deep chorus. Ever and anon some sinner who felt his
burden removed would burst out in a song of triumph and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">{188}</a></span>
loud hosannah; others, who had been groaning for hours
in the deepest agony, or sitting silent, sullen, and dejected,
like images of unutterable woe, would arise with a glory
upon their countenances, and words of praise and exultation
on their lips. Many entirely lost the use of their
limbs, and lay a long time as if entranced. At these meetings
there would generally be several ministers, who would
officiate at the same time in different parts of the congregation,
some in exhortation, some in praying for the distressed,
and some in arguments with opposers, who considered
such proceedings the height of fanaticism.</p>

<h4>FIRST SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, VERONA,
ONEIDA COUNTY, NEW YORK.</h4>

<p>This church was organized in 1820, although several
years previous a number of families of Seventh-day Baptists
had removed from Hopkinton and settled in this
place, where they kept up meetings on the Sabbath. The
large and respectable family of Williamses appears to have
been the principal support of this infant church, which,
until 1842, remained without the services of a settled
pastor, when</p>

<p>Rev. Charles M. Lewis assumed the spiritual charge.</p>

<p>Rev. Christopher Chester, his successor, was installed
in 1848.</p>

<p>A branch church was organized at Schenectady in 1834.
John Maxson became its deacon, but so far as I am aware
it never had a settled pastor. It continued only a few
years. A church was likewise organized in Baltimore the
same year, which long since ceased to exist.</p>

<h4>SECOND SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, VERONA,
ONEIDA COUNTY, NEW YORK.</h4>

<p>This church, a branch of the former, was organized in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">{189}</a></span>
1837, but remained in a destitute condition until 1842,
when Rev. Elihu Robinson became its pastor, in which relation
he continued for several years.</p>

<p>At present they have no settled pastor.</p>

<h4>SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, WATSON, LEWIS
COUNTY, NEW YORK.</h4>

<p>This church was organized in 1841. Joshua Clarke
and William G. Quibell were recognised as licentiates in
its connexion. Subsequently they received ordination,
and the latter assumed the parochial charge, in which he
still continues.</p>

<p>This church, although in its infancy, gives great promise
of future efficiency and usefulness.</p>

<h4>SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, NEWPORT, HERKIMER
COUNTY, NEW YORK.</h4>

<p>This small but interesting community was formed in
1838. It has received ministerial assistance from the
Missionary Society at different times, although deprived of
the services of a settled pastor.</p>

<p>Elihu Robinson officiated as licentiate in this place for
a short period.</p>

<h4>EXTINCT CHURCHES.</h4>

<p>In 1820, a branch of the Berlin Church was organized
in Fox Township, Clearfield County, Pennsylvania, which
continued for several years in a flourishing condition. In
1822, John Bliss was ordained to the work of the ministry,
and subsequently Jeremiah Bliss was returned as licentiate.
But many evil influences were at work, which this church,
always weak and feeble, was unable to withstand. Its decline
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">{190}</a></span>
may be dated from 1832, since which period it gradually
sunk, its members removed into other parts, and
finally it ceased to exist.</p>

<p>It may be conceded that neither legal enactments, penal
statutes, nor popular customs, can suppress the course of
truth, or prevent the exercise of its legitimate effects upon
the minds of men. The progress of our denomination, notwithstanding
the adverse circumstances and many disadvantages
under which we have laboured, has been steady
and unceasing; and although many of our churches are in
a state of infancy, their numbers are respectable, and their
influence considerable.</p>

<p>Many ministers who have arisen in these fraternities,
have removed thence into other parts. Ministers distinguished
for evangelical enterprise and fervent zeal, some
of whom have been among the first pioneers of the gospel
in the western regions.</p>

<p>In connexion with these churches are some very efficient
High Schools, and one Literary Institution of a
higher class. It is true that these institutions are not of
a theological character; nevertheless, they are important
appendages of the denomination, and, if well managed,
will become what is most needed, and will confer immense
benefits upon the community at large. The general diffusion
of knowledge will elevate the moral and intellectual
standard, and will be the sure forerunner of higher ministerial
attainments, and the better management of the
churches.</p>

 <h3>SECTION VI.<br />
 <small>WESTERN ASSOCIATION.</small></h3>

</div>

<p>The churches embraced in this Association, are situated
on what was formerly considered missionary ground, although
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">{191}</a></span>
some of them are at present among the most efficient
bodies in the denomination. The principal ornament
of this section is the Alfred Academy, a very flourishing
literary institution, of a high classical character. It
appears to have originated from a High School, and went
into operation two or three years previous to the De Ruyter
Institute.</p>

<h4>FIRST SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH ALFRED, ALLEGHANY
COUNTY, NEW YORK.</h4>

<p>This church was originally composed of emigrants from
the Rhode Island and New Jersey fraternities, and was
constituted in 1816. The region at that time was extremely
destitute, and these pioneers of our faith were required to
undergo many hardships, and experience great deprivations
in the prosecution of their schemes. Generally their
means were moderate, and their worldly advantages limited;
but they were zealous for the truth and rich in faith.
They found a wilderness, here and there broken by the
hand of man: they left smiling fields and growing villages.
They found penury and destitution: they left wealth and
plenty. They found a region where the songs of David
were not repeated, where the Sabbath was not observed:
they left flourishing schools and churches. Did they live
in vain?</p>

<p>Rev. Amos Satterlee was installed as pastor of the
Alfred Church in 1820, which station he filled with great
acceptance for several years.</p>

<p>His successors, Daniel Babcock and Richard Hull, were
ordained in 1824, and remained with this church about
fifteen years, when they removed to other fields.</p>

<p>Rev. James R. Irish became their pastor in 1837, in
which relation he continued until 1846.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">{192}</a></span></p>

<p>During the ministry of these brethren, the church has
been blessed at intervals with many precious revivals; and
it appears to have been from the first in a sound and
healthy condition.</p>

<p>Rev. Hiram Cromwell, his successor, remained for only
a short period, and was succeeded by</p>

<p>Rev. N. V. Hull, the present incumbent.</p>

<p>Elder Hull is endowed with talents of the very highest
order, and perhaps no minister in the denomination is
better qualified to shine in a promiscuous assembly. His
fine understanding, ready wit, and brilliant imagination,
are united to the most fascinating powers of oratory, a demeanour
of princely elegance, and the highest style of
manly beauty. His services either as a settled pastor, or
visiting evangelist, have been highly efficient in this region,
and his preaching has been attended with many powerful
revivals.</p>

<h4>SECOND SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, ALFRED, ALLEGHANY
COUNTY, NEW YORK.</h4>

<p>This church, a branch of the former, was organized in
1831, and Elder Ray Green became its pastor. In 1835
Clarke Potter and N. V. Hull were returned as licentiates
in its connexion. In 1842, Amos Burdick was also licensed,
who continued to serve this church after the removal of
Elder Green, until 1844, when</p>

<p>Rev. James H. Cochran assumed the pastoral charge.</p>

<p>He was succeeded by Amos Burdick and P. C. Witter,
the present incumbents.</p>

<h4>FIRST SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, GENESEE,
NEW YORK.</h4>

<p>This church was organized in 1827, and Henry P. Green
served as licentiate until 1835, when his ordination took
place. Under his ministry, which continued until 1847,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">{193}</a></span>
the church received many additions, and became a large
and efficient body.</p>

<p>Rev. James Bailey, his successor, was installed in 1848.</p>

<h4>SECOND SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, GENESEE,
NEW YORK.</h4>

<p>This church, a branch of the former, was organized in
1834, and was served by Prentice C. Maine as licentiate,
for some time. At present it has no settled pastor, but is
supplied with ministerial assistance by travelling missionaries.</p>

<h4>THIRD SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, GENESEE,
NEW YORK.</h4>

<p>This church, likewise a branch of the former, was organized
in 1842, but remained until 1843 without a settled
pastor, when their spiritual charge was assumed by L. D.
Ayres, who remained until 1847.</p>

<p>Rev. H. P. Green, the present incumbent, was installed
1848.</p>

<h4>SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, CLARENCE, ERIE COUNTY,
NEW YORK.</h4>

<p>This church was organized in 1828, although Sabbatarians
had for some time previous been among the inhabitants
of the country, and maintained worship upon their
holy day. They remained for a long time without a pastor,
but, in 1838, Rev. Nathan V. Hull consented to settle among
them. In 1839, James H. Cochran was returned as licentiate,
and subsequently, in 1846, as pastor.</p>

<p>At present they have no settled minister.</p>

<h4>SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, FRIENDSHIP, NEW YORK.</h4>

<p>This community, like that of Alfred, dates back to an
early period. It originated, likewise, from an emigration
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">{194}</a></span>
of the members of older churches. Between the years
1812 and 1820, many families in connexion with the New
Jersey fraternities removed to this place, and became the
pioneers of our faith in its then lonely regions. In 1824
a church was constituted. Rev. John Green became its
first pastor, in which relation he continued until 1833,
when</p>

<p>Rev. Walter B. Gillette succeeded him, and remained
until 1842, when he removed to another field.</p>

<p>Rev. Zuriel Campbell followed, who continued until
1845.</p>

<p>Rev. A. A. F. Randolph, his successor, had been for
some time his colleague.</p>

<p>Rev. B. F. Robbins, a man of deep piety and irreproachable
character, who embraced the Sabbath in 1845, is the
present incumbent.</p>

<p>A short time since Elder John Green visited this place,
and his presence, as usual, was attended with a gracious
revival.</p>

<h4>SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, HARTSVILLE, ALLEGHANY
COUNTY, NEW YORK.</h4>

<p>This infant community, a branch of the Alfred Church,
was organized in 1847.</p>

<p>Rev. Hiram Cornwell is its present pastor.</p>

<p>It gives a cheering promise of future efficiency and
usefulness.</p>

<h4>SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, HAYFIELD, PENNSYLVANIA.</h4>

<p>This church is the oldest one in this Association, and
originated from the Keithian Seventh-day Baptists, who,
in 1770, resided in the neighbourhood of Philadelphia.
About this time it appears that Rev. James Dunn, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">{195}</a></span>
several families of Sabbatarians, removed to this place,
where he instituted meetings and organized a church, over
which he assumed the pastoral relation. Elder Dunn lived
to be very old, but sometime previous to his decease, his
reason failed, and he became partially insane. This misfortune,
combined with other disadvantages, brought the
church into a state of deep depression. In 1821, Rev.
John Davis, of Shiloh, made them a visit, and by their
unanimous request ordained Isaac Davis to the work of the
ministry. Subsequently, however, the church remained in
very low circumstances, and in 1829, at which time it was
admitted into the General Conference, it only numbered
twenty-four members, and was without a settled pastor.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_41" id="Ref_41" href="#Foot_41">[41]</a></span>
Beside the occasional visits of missionaries, it remained
thus destitute until 1836, when</p>

<p>Rev. Job Tyler removed into that region and assumed
the pastoral charge.</p>

<p>Rev. Thomas B. Brown, his colleague in 1840 and 1841,
and subsequently his successor, was installed in 1842, and
continued until 1844.</p>

<p>Morris Cole succeeded him as licentiate, in which relation
he served the church until 1846, when</p>

<p>Rev. A. A. F. Randolph, the present incumbent, was
installed.</p>

<h4>SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, INDEPENDENCE,
NEW YORK.</h4>

<p>This church was organized in 1834, with very auspicious
prospects, and</p>

<p>Rev. Stillman Coon became its pastor, in which relation
he continued until 1842, when, being transferred to another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">{196}</a></span>
field, the church was served by Decatur M. Clarke, as
licentiate, for two or three years.</p>

<p>Rev. Sherman S. Griswold, assumed the parochial charge
in 1845, and continued two years.</p>

<p>Rev. T. Babcock, the present pastor, was installed in
1848.</p>

<h4>SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, WIRT, ALLEGHANY
COUNTY, NEW YORK.</h4>

<p>At a very early period in the history of this district,
Sabbath-keepers were found among its inhabitants, chiefly
emigrants from the older settlements, but they were not
gathered and arranged into a church until 1827. Subsequent
to that period they remained in low and depressed
circumstances, which may be chiefly attributed to their
want of the services of a settled pastor. Recently, however,
they have been mostly supplied with ministerial
assistance by</p>

<p>Rev. James L. Scott, until 1845, when they engaged
the services of</p>

<p>Rev. Zuriel Campbell for one year; who was succeeded
by Rev. Thomas E. Babcock.</p>

<p>C. T. Champlin, the present incumbent, is a licentiate.</p>

<h4>SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, SCIO, ALLEGHANY COUNTY,
NEW YORK.</h4>

<p>This church was organized in 1834, but remained for a
long time without many additions, or the services of a settled
pastor.</p>

<p>Rev. Ray Green assumed the parochial charge in 1845,
and continued until 1847.</p>

<p>Rev. Rowse Babcock, the present incumbent, was installed
in 1848.</p>

<p>In reviewing the progress of Sabbatarianism within the
bounds of this Association, we find abundant reasons for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">{197}</a></span>
encouragement. An interest hitherto unprecedented in
the modern history of the Sabbath-keepers, has been
awakened. Many have embraced the truth in opposition
to the popular sentiments of the day, among whom are
several ministers of eminent talent and piety, who may be
reckoned as pillars in the cause of God.</p>

<p>The number of churches has proportionately increased,
but it must be confessed that many of them are infant
bodies, utterly unable to support the pastor whose services
they require, and without whose presence they can never
rise to any degree of strength and usefulness. They want
such pastors as the Hopkinton, the Berlin, the Piscataway,
and the Shiloh Churches possessed during the first century
of their existence. Men who could preach the truth for
its own sake, who could share with and for their brethren—live
as they did—dress as they did—and even work as
they did.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_42" id="Ref_42" href="#Foot_42">[42]</a></span> Under such plain but substantial guidance,
these churches all rose to great spiritual strength and permanence.
Whatever honour belongs to him who is instrumental
in gathering and organizing a church, much
more is justly due to the one, who, at the expense of personal
sacrifices and temporal inconveniences, adopts the
spiritual infant, administers to its necessities, leads it
through the green pastures and by the still waters of the
heavenly pilgrimage, and finally brings it to such a degree
of maturity that it is able to go alone. It is a lamentable
fact, that some of these churches for the want of such
leaders are even now threatened with extinction. Upon
whom in such cases must the delinquency rest?</p>

 <h3>SECTION VII.<br />
 <small>SOUTHWESTERN ASSOCIATION.</small></h3>

</div>

<p>Most of the churches embraced in this confederacy are
of recent origin. Many of them occupy highly advantageous
situations in the broad, the bright, the glorious
West, and give every promise of rising to future eminence
and usefulness.</p>

<h4>SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, NEW SALEM, HARRISON
COUNTY, VIRGINIA.</h4>

<p>The history of this church, the oldest one in this Association,
is highly interesting. It appears that in 1745, a
company of Sabbath-keepers, including one John Davis,
removed from Rhode Island, to a place called Square, in
Monmouth County, New Jersey. Here they organized a
church, and sent said Davis back to Westerly to be ordained,
which was done in 1746. They remained here
nearly forty years, when the whole church, men, women,
and children, emigrated to the place that their descendants
now inhabit in Virginia. They went in wagons,
drove their cattle, and the cavalcade was many days in
performing their journey. Their venerable minister continued
with them for many years. He was also assisted
by one Jacob Davis, who was esteemed as a very amiable
man and worthy minister.</p>

<p>Rev. John Davis his son and successor, was installed
about 1800, and continued to serve the church for a number
of years. Zebulon Maxson, Peter Davis, and Lewis
A. Davis, were likewise associated with him in the ministry
at different times, and</p>

<p>Rev. Peter Davis finally succeeded him in 1834, in
which relation he still continues.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">{199}</a></span></p>

<p>Ezekiel Bee is a licentiate in connexion with this
church.</p>

<h4>SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, LOST CREEK, VIRGINIA.</h4>

<p>This church was constituted in 1805, and the large and
respectable family of Bonds—its first originators—appear
to be still its principal supporters. Richard Bond, while a
resident in Maryland, became convinced of the sacred character
of the seventh day, from reading the Bible alone.
Once convinced of his duty he was not slow in performing
it; but embracing the Sabbath, he instituted weekly religious
meetings in his family, and was, for a long time, the
priest of his household. Subsequently he emigrated to
Virginia, and became the founder of the Lost Creek
Church. This church has never been large, and for a
great proportion of the time it has been without the services
of a stated pastor, but the fact of its steady and uniform
course amidst these privations, affords conclusive evidence
of the valuable materials of which it is composed.</p>

<p>Richard C. Bond, the present incumbent, was installed
in 1843.</p>

<h4>SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, HUGHES RIVER, VIRGINIA.</h4>

<p>This church, a branch of the former, was organized in
1833. It is in a very weak and depressed condition, containing
only seven members.</p>

<h4>SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, SOUTH FORK, HUGHES
RIVER, VIRGINIA.</h4>

<p>This church, another branch of the eldest fraternity,
was constituted in 1842. It contains only nineteen members,
and was served by Asa Bee and Joshua S. Davis, as
licentiates.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">{200}</a></div>

<h4>SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, NORTHAMPTON,
CLARKE COUNTY, OHIO.</h4>

<p>This church originated from a division, on the temperance
question, in the Sabbatarian church at Pike, in the
same county. It was organized with seventeen of the
seceding members, in 1837. In 1840, it was blessed with
a precious revival, and received many additions.</p>

<p>Rev. Samuel Babcock is the present pastor, assisted by
L. Lippencott as licentiate.</p>

<h4>SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, PIKE, CLARKE COUNTY,
OHIO.</h4>

<p>This church was constituted in 1824, although Sabbatarians
had for some time previous resided in that region.</p>

<p>Rev. Simeon Babcock and Rev. Samuel F. Randolph,
were for several years connected with these churches,
under whose ministry they were greatly blessed, and the
fraternity under consideration numbered 102 members.
Subsequently, however, it fell into a decline. The secession
of a part of its members, the death and removal of
others, combined with other causes, left it in a very weak
condition. In 1842, James B. Davis was a licentiate in
its connexion. At present it has no stated pastor.</p>

<h4>SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, PORT JEFFERSON,
SHELBY COUNTY, OHIO.</h4>

<p>This church was organized in 1840, and contained nineteen
members. It is in a very pleasant situation, and
gives great promise of future usefulness.</p>

<p>Rev. Lewis A. Davis has been the father, and is the
pastor of this church.</p>

<h4>SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, SCIOTA, OHIO.</h4>

<p>This church was organized in 1842, by emigrant members
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">{201}</a></span>
from Scott and Brookfield. It is situated in a very
pleasant country, and will probably become, in time, a
large and efficient body.</p>

<p>It is occupied as missionary ground, but has no stated
pastor.</p>

<h4>SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, STOKES, OHIO.</h4>

<p>This church was organized in the same year as the former,
and is much in the same condition. It is blessed
with the services of Rev. Joshua Hill, as pastor.</p>

<h4>SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, JACKSON, OHIO.</h4>

<p>This church was organized in 1840, and embraced thirty-eight
members, most of whom had removed from Pike,
Clarke County, to this place. For some time it appeared
quite flourishing, and received several additions, but it is
at present in a very low and depressed condition, owing to
the want of ministerial assistance.</p>

<h4>SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, WOODBRIDGETOWN,
PENNSYLVANIA.</h4>

<p>This church was gathered through the exertions of Rev.
Samuel Woodbridge, and was organized about 1790. All
the knowledge that I have been able to obtain of Elder
Woodbridge is, that he was a First-day Baptist minister,
who became convinced of the sacred character of the
seventh day, and embraced it accordingly. Subsequently
he removed to this place with his family, where his preaching
was blessed to the conversion of many, a church organized,
and a meeting-house erected, whose pulpit he occupied
until his death. This church likewise received several
additions from an emigration of the members of the Nottingham
and Pennapack fraternities, among whom we may mention
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">{202}</a></span>
the children of Rev. Enoch David. But the death of
Elder Woodbridge was the commencement of its decline, as
no one arose to take his place. Its ancient and venerable
meeting-house, being without a pastor, soon became almost
deserted. Some of its members removed to other parts,
and others of them went to receive their reward for loving
the law and keeping the commandments of God. In 1843,
they numbered sixteen, and Lewis Sammons served the
church as licentiate. Since that period its decline has
been gradual, and it is a moral certainty that but a very
short time will elapse before we shall have to announce
the disappearance of another star from our constellation,
the extinction of another luminary in the moral world.</p>

<h4>SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, MADISON, INDIANA.</h4>

<p>This small company of Sabbath-keepers was organized
into a church in 1848, since which period it has received
few additions, and has been in a low and depressed condition
for the want of pastoral services.</p>

<h3>SECTION VIII.<br />
<small>NORTHWESTERN ASSOCIATION.</small></h3>

<h4>SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, MILTON, ROCK COUNTY,
WISCONSIN.</h4>

</div>

<p>This large and flourishing church was organized in 1838,
since which period it has rapidly increased in numbers,
and promises to become a very useful and efficient body.
For a long time this region was considered as missionary
ground. Recently, however,</p>

<p>Rev. Stillman Coon and Rev. Zuriel Campbell have connected
themselves in the pastoral relation with the church,
in which they still continue.</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">{203}</a></div>

<p>Many of its members were emigrants from Scott and
the older churches.</p>

<h4>SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, ALBION, DANE COUNTY,
WISCONSIN.</h4>

<p>This church was organized in 1843, and</p>

<p>Wm. H. Redfield became its servant in the capacity of
licentiate, which relation he sustained for one year, when
he was succeeded by</p>

<p>Rev. O. P. Hull, the present incumbent, under whose
ministry it has enjoyed many precious seasons, and received
many additions.</p>

<h4>SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, WALWORTH, WISCONSIN.</h4>

<p>This church, mostly composed of emigrants from New
Jersey, was organized in 1849, and contains twenty-one
members, with a prospect of large additions.</p>

<p>It has no settled pastor.</p>

<h4>SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, FREDONIA, IOWA.</h4>

<p>This church was organized in 1842, and
Rev. Rolean M'Reynolds, formerly a First-day Baptist,
a minister of exemplary character and eminent talent, became
its pastor, in which relation he continued for some
time.</p>

<p>At present it has no settled pastor.</p>

<h4>SEVENTH-DAY BAPTIST CHURCH, FARMINGTON, ILLINOIS.</h4>

<p>This church was constituted in 1849, and consists mostly
of emigrants from Shiloh, with the family of</p>

<p>Rev. Samuel Davison, the present pastor.</p>

<p>It is said to occupy a pleasant and healthful situation.</p>

<h4>REMARKS.</h4>

<p>A majority of the churches embraced in this Association
may be considered as enjoying all the advantages of a
healthful climate and fertile soil, with facilities for commerce.
Although few in numbers, their prospects are
most encouraging, perhaps too much so. It is not in the
sunlight of worldly prosperity that the good seed rises to
maturity and bears much fruit: the mind, exulting in
temporal advantages, the accumulation of riches, or the
acquisition of worldly honours, is too apt to become cold
and indifferent to the subject of religion. We trust that
it may not be so with these sister fraternities, who have
designed to hold up the light of the truth, and to witness
for the Sabbath among an apostatizing community. May
they grow in grace as in numbers; may they become rich
in heavenly wisdom as in earthly goods; moreover, as
they have received liberally may they be disposed to give
liberally, and to bear in their hearts and upon their prayers
the burdens of a perishing world. In connexion with this
subject another consideration is presented. These churches
occupy situations as desirable as can be found throughout
the whole country for mercantile, mechanical, or agricultural
avocations, and embrace every variety of soil, scenery,
and climate. Some are located on broad meadow-like
prairie; others amid a diversified landscape of hills and
valleys; and yet others in the neighbourhood of marts of
commerce, and communicating with lakes and rivers. No
brother need forsake the Sabbath, in order to find a more
eligible or advantageous situation than could be obtained
in contiguity with the settlements of the Sabbath-keepers;
and no person, whatever may be his denominational character,
who wishes to emigrate, will find in any locality a
state of society more elevated, moral, and Christian-like,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">{205}</a></span>
or schools more really useful and well-conducted than are
to be found among the Sabbatarians. In tracing the history
of our denomination, there occur many reflections of
a pleasant and interesting character, particularly in connexion
with our missionary efforts. The review of the
fields of labour thus occupied would prefigure in a remarkable
degree our gradual expansion and increase. First we
see those good old fathers, over whose graves the flowers
of centennial summers have bloomed and withered, making
short journeys from Rhode Island to New Jersey, and perhaps
to some parts of Pennsylvania. This, at that time,
was missionary ground. Subsequently the area was extended.
Where was the missionary ground in their youth
to those venerable men who have grown gray in the service
of the sanctuary? In the wildly beautiful and romantic
region of western New York and Pennsylvania, where a
glorious harvest has arisen as the fruit of their labours.
Then gradually expanding westward, Ohio, Wisconsin, and
Iowa, became alternately the theatres of new scenes of
trial and triumph. Intimately connected with the progress
of our denomination in this region are the names of Rev.
L. A. Davis and Rev. J. L. Scott, both indefatigable missionaries,
through whose instrumentality several of these
churches have been gathered and organized. Is not our
missionary ground still expanding? Does not the time
approach when the broad plains of the Missouri will be
so occupied? when the region of the Rocky Mountains will
be so occupied? when Oregon and California will be so
occupied? Does it appear impossible or improbable? All
that is necessary for its realization, is the application of
means, and faith in the promises of God.</p>

<h3>SECTION IX.<br />
<small>GENERAL SUMMARY.</small></h3>

</div>

<p>The reader who has followed me through this brief and
imperfect sketch of the history of the Seventh-day Baptist
Denomination, cannot fail to perceive that our churches
have gradually and healthfully increased in numbers, notwithstanding
the continual opposition which is manifested to
the cause we advocate, and the continual discouragements
that we have to encounter both in society and business. It
is now about one hundred and seventy years since the first
Seventh-day Baptist church was organized in America;
and the efforts which have been made within the last thirty
years have accomplished more to advance the interests of
the cause than what was done for nearly a century and a
half preceding. This has not been produced by any special
excitement, but by increased energy and courage, and
by the multiplication of means for disseminating the truth;
and those means have but just begun to develope their influence.
Our Education, Missionary, and Tract Societies
are yet in their infancy; our denominational paper is
only beginning to acquire a circulation corresponding to
its merits, indicative to other denominations of Christians
of our literary resources,—and yet effects that would
have astonished our ancestors have been realized. In 1805,
we numbered eight churches, and about one thousand five
hundred communicants. Twenty-five years increased that
number to three thousand four hundred; but the five subsequent
years to more than four thousand five hundred.
In 1840, we numbered a fraction over five thousand members,
which in three years increased to six thousand. At
this period, there are about seven thousand communicants
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">{207}</a></span>
in the connexion. There are sixty-five churches united
with the Conference; sixty ordained ministers, and about
thirty licentiates.</p>

<p>In dating the organization of the churches, I have had
recourse to Clarke's History, and to the old Conference
Minutes; between which and the minutes for 1849, I discovered
some discrepancies. Should the reader wish to
institute a comparison between my work and other documents,
he will please refer to these sources, by which, for
several reasons, I consider it safest to be guided.</p>

<p>Besides these churches, there are many scattered families
of Sabbath-keepers in different parts of the Union. The
Rev. Isaac P. Labagh, a minister of eminent ability and
attainment, in connexion with the Episcopal Church in
New York, is an observer of the Sabbath.</p>

<h4>CONCLUSION.</h4>

<p>It may be observed, in conclusion, that these churches exhibit
nothing peculiar in their forms of worship. Psalmody
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">{210}</a></span>
is universally practised, and the science of vocal music is
cultivated in all the older churches.</p>

<p>Previous to 1822, Rippon's Collection of Hymns was
generally used. About that time a new collection, designed
particularly for this denomination, was made and
published by a committee appointed for that purpose by
the General Conference. Recently that collection has
been superseded by another, which is in present use.</p>

<p>Sabbath schools and Bible classes have been instituted,
and generally receive attention in all the churches; and
the same may be said of conference and prayer meetings.</p>

<p>There are also tract and missionary societies within the
bosoms of the different fraternities, whose officers constitute
the board for the transaction of business.</p>

It is questionable, however, whether Mr. Jones will be an addition
to our society or not, since he appears to be a man of inferior abilities
and attainments, and one disposed to meddle with subjects above his
capacity or information.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_37" id="Foot_37" href="#Ref_37">[37]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
In the autumn of 1850 Elder Rogers was removed by death.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_38" id="Foot_38" href="#Ref_38">[38]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
The large and respectable families of the Swinneys, Tomlinsons,
and Thomases, were among the earliest members of the Shiloh Church.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_39" id="Foot_39" href="#Ref_39">[39]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Since the above was written, this church has been visited by a most
extraordinary and afflictive dispensation of Providence. Elder Crandall,
supposed to be labouring under a temporary fit of insanity, put a period
to his existence by suspending himself from a beam in his barn, in September,
1850.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_40" id="Foot_40" href="#Ref_40">[40]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
Since writing the above, I have been verbally informed that Elder
Joel Green was called to preside over the church at Hounsfield, as colleague
to Elder William Green, to the great dissatisfaction of the latter,
and in consequence of which, such a great difficulty arose, that the
ministrations of both were suspended,—but I will not vouch for the
accuracy of this statement.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_41" id="Foot_41" href="#Ref_41">[41]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
For all the incidents relating to the early history of this organization,
I am indebted to Rev. John Davis, of Shiloh.</p>

<p class="nodent"><a name="Foot_42" id="Foot_42" href="#Ref_42">[42]</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
One of these fathers, who was considered no mean preacher in his
day, and who was instrumental, not only in organizing, but in supporting
and bringing to maturity an infant church, used to remark that he
desired no better time for studying a sermon than when following the
plough.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />
<small>SEVENTH-DAY BAPTISTS IN THE UNITED STATES, CONTINUED.</small></h2>

<h3>SECTION I.<br />
<small>THE KEITHIAN SEVENTH-DAY BAPTISTS.</small></h3>

</div>

<p><span class="smc">The</span> Keithian Baptists were seceders from the Quakers
of Pennsylvania, and were so called from their leader, the
famous George Keith, who, in 1691, with forty-eight other
individuals, withdrew from the communion of the Quakers,
and set up separate meetings in different places, and a
general one at Burlington, in opposition to that of Philadelphia.
Subsequently they published several works of a
controversial character, and finally, by resigning themselves
to the guidance of Scripture, they became altogether
Baptist in their religious practices. At the time of this
change in their denominational character they numbered
four churches, of which one was situated at Upper Providence,
another at Philadelphia, a third at Southampton,
and a fourth at Dublin. These continued for some time,
but in 1700, a difference arose among them concerning the
Sabbath, that broke up their societies. Some of them
contended rightly that the original Sabbath remained unchanged,
and that its observance was still incumbent upon
Christians. The division appears to have been fomented
by one Abel Noble, who, according to Morgan Edwards,
came to this country in 1684, and who appears to have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">{212}</a></span>
been the first Seventh-day Baptist in the state of Pennsylvania.
His name is found among those who, in 1691,
signed the articles of the Keithian separation. By him
was the first Keithian baptized in 1697, and by him were
they gained over to the observance of the seventh day.
Through his instrumentality four churches of that order
were constituted. The first at Newtown, in Upper Providence,
about twenty-four miles from the city of Philadelphia.
Their meeting was held at the house of one
David Thomas. Three families belonged to this place, of
whom seven individuals were baptized members of the
church, in 1770.</p>

<p>Another society resided at Pennapack, in the county of
Philadelphia. It was to this society that Richard Sparks
belonged, and to it he donated the lot of land for a burial-place,
which subsequently became the property of the
Shiloh and Piscataway Churches. William Davis was their
minister. He was baptized in 1697, by Rev. Thomas
Killingworth, of Cohansey, now Greenwich. In 1701,
they built a place for worship in Oxford township, on a
lot given to them by Thomas Graves, but neglecting to
take a deed in due time, the Episcopalians dispossessed
them of both the house and lot. In 1711, their preacher,
William Davis, leaving them, and no one rising to supply
the vacancy, they were soon scattered like sheep without
a shepherd. The third society of them was at Nottingham,
about fifty miles from Philadelphia. Their meetings were
sometimes held at the house of Abigail Price, and at
others in the dwelling of Samuel Bond, in the contiguous
state of Maryland. The Sabbatarian families to which
Nottingham was central, were six, of which eight persons
were baptized. Here a yearly meeting was kept during
the last week in August, 1770. This church originated
from the Keithians at Upper Providence; but being destitute
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">{213}</a></span>
of a settled pastor, it received few additions. Its
most influential members were the family of Samuel Bond,
whose son, Richard Bond, became subsequently the founder
of a Sabbatarian church in Virginia.</p>

<p>Another society of them was in East Nantmill Township,
about thirty-two miles from Philadelphia. Here was a
meeting-house, built in 1762, on a lot of one acre square,
the gift of David Rogers. The Sabbatarian families in
this place were six, of whom ten individuals were baptized.
They had no settled pastor, and subsequently they removed
in a body to French Creek, near Meadville, and became
the fathers of the present church at Hayfield. Thus it
appears that in 1770 there were twenty-six families of
Sabbatarians in Pennsylvania, and thirty-one baptized individuals
of that order. That they had two yearly meetings
and one meeting-house. At this time also they had
one minister, Rev. Enoch David. He was born in 1718,
at Duck Creek, county of Kent, in the state of Delaware;
called to the ministry, at Welshart, in 1751; and ordained
in 1769. He was married four times, and became the
father of nine children. Ebenezer, his oldest son, was
considered a very promising young man. He entered
Rhode Island college as a student in 1770, and became a
member of the Newport Church the same year. He was
ordained to the work of the ministry in 1775, and being a
young man, accepted the office of chaplain in the American
army, under Washington, where he remained until his
death, in 1778. He was highly esteemed by both officers
and soldiers, and afforded every promise of future eminence
and usefulness.</p>

<p>About this time, Zedekiah David, with several others,
removed to Fayette County, and became the founders of a
Seventh-day Baptist church in that place, where Rev.
Samuel Woodbridge exercised his ministry for many years.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">{214}</a></span>
To his children and to the church in this place, Rev. Enoch
David paid a visit in the autumn of 1795, where, preaching
in the open air, he caught a violent cold, which settled on
his lungs, and finally terminated in a consumption, of
which he died in the seventy-seventh year of his age, and
the fortieth of his ministry. His remains were deposited
in the burial-place at Woodbridgetown, in the certain hope
of a joyful resurrection.</p>

<p>This venerable man was one of the good old ministers of
the ancient school, who could preach the truth for its own
sake, and who neither required nor expected a salary. He
supported his numerous family by working at his trade,
that of a tailor. Four times he was left a widower, and
each time with the care of an infant. He lived to see six
of his children consigned to the grave. He had an estate
of some value in the city of Philadelphia, which was sold
at his decease and the proceeds divided among his family.</p>

<p>From the church in East Nantmill Township, Pennsylvania,
a church was formed on Broad River, in the parish
of St. Mark, South Carolina, in 1754. In 1770, it had
increased to eighteen families, of whom twenty-four persons
were baptized. At this time there were several churches
of the Dunker Baptists, in this state, who observed the
seventh day.</p>

<p>In 1759, eight families of the Seventh-day Baptists
passed over from South Carolina, and settled near Suckaseesing,
in Georgia. Their leader was Richard Gregory,
son of John Gregory. Another of their preachers was
named Clayton. After remaining here about five years,
the whole company returned to Edisto, in South Carolina.</p>

<p>It is believed that these churches have been for a long
time extinct.</p>

<h3>SECTION II.<br />
<small>A GENERAL HISTORY OF THE GERMAN SEVENTH-DAY BAPTISTS.</small></h3>

</div>

<p>The Reformation in Germany and Holland was productive
of great and glorious effects, although it was not complete.
Errors in doctrine, nearly or quite as incongruous
with Scripture as those abandoned, were retained; ceremonies,
nearly equal in absurdity to those prohibited, were still
celebrated; and persecutions, exhibiting more similarity to
the practices of Papacy than to the meekness and quietude
of pure Christianity, were still prosecuted. The Reformation
required to be reformed, and of this many pious and
holy men were aware. At length, in 1694, a violent controversy
arose in nearly all the Protestant churches of those
two countries, in consequence of the attempts which were
being made to promote a practical and vital religion. At
this time the pious Spener was ecclesiastical superintendent
of the court of Saxony. He was likewise at the head
of the party distinguished for its advocacy of reformatory
measures. However, neither his dignified and important
station, nor the fact that the tenets of his followers were
predicated upon scripture according to its literal interpretation,
could preserve them from falling under the odium
of heresy, and incurring the effects of a virulent opposition.
Their doctrines were examined by the ecclesiastical dignitaries,
who, instead of instituting a comparison between
them and Holy Writ, sought to discover whether or not
they were conformable to the tenets deemed orthodox by
the Consistory of Wittemberg. The decision was in the
negative; hence they were suppressed in their public lectures
and ministrations. This prohibition, while it shut up
churches, and hushed the eloquence of public lecturers,
savoured of persecution, and consequently excited a spirit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">{216}</a></span>
of inquiry in the minds of the multitude. In such cases as
this, reverend divines would consult their own interest by
bestowing greater attention upon the study of human
nature. Persecution agitates the public mind, excites the
sympathy of some, the curiosity of all, and promulgates
the very sentiments it is endeavouring to restrain. Besides,
persecutors are not omniscient, conventicles will be held,
and to their other charms that of secrecy is then added.
In the year 1708, Alexander Mack, of Schriesheim, and
seven others in Schwartzenen, Germany, met together,
regularly to examine, in a careful and impartial manner,
the doctrines of the New Testament, in order to ascertain
what obligations it imposes upon professing Christians.
These inquiries terminated in the formation of the society
now called the Dunkers, or First-day German Baptists.
Persecution, while it scattered them, likewise led to the
dissemination of their doctrines; some were driven to
Crefelt, in the Duchy of Cleves, and the mother church
voluntarily removed to Sevustervin, in Friesland, whence
its members emigrated to America in 1719, and dispersed
to different parts of Pennsylvania. In 1723, they formed
a church at Germantown, under the pastoral care of Peter
Becker. The rapid growth of this church has rarely been
excelled, and it received continual accessions of new members
from the banks of the Wissahickon, and from Lancaster
County. In this county, another community was soon after
established by Conrad Beissel, a native of Germany. He
was a man of eminent piety and ability, much given to
metaphysical speculations, and distinguished for his love of
solitude. Being determined to seek out the true obligations
of the Word of God, independent of all preconceived
opinions and traditional observances, he was soon
led to perceive that the sentiments of the Dunkers were
erroneous so far as they related to the day designed to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">{217}</a></span>
hallowed as the Sabbath. It appeared evident to him "that
the seventh day was the command of the Lord God, and
that day being established and sanctified by the Great
Jehovah, for ever, and no change, nor authority for change,
ever having been announced to man, by any power sufficient
to set aside the solemn decree of the Almighty, he
felt it to be his duty to contend for the observance of that
day." These opinions he maintained, not only in many
eloquent discourses, but, about the year 1725, he published
a short treatise which entered into a full and very able
discussion of this point. The publication of this tract
formed, in more ways than one, an epoch in the community,
and created so much stir and excitement among the Society
at Mill Creek, that Beissel quietly retired from the settlement,
and took up his abode in a small cell on the banks
of the Cocalico, which had been occupied previously by one
Elimelech, an anchorite. Here, retired from all the
world, he sought, by prayer, fasting, and meditation, to
converse with superior intelligences, and to perfect himself
in holy knowledge. But the community that had
opposed his fervent and spiritual teachings when present,
found his absence a great deprivation, and although many
inquiries were made, it was a long time before the place
of his retirement became known. By this time many
members of the society at Mill Creek had become convinced
of the truth of his proposition relative to the
Sabbath, who now removed and settled around him in
solitary cottages. They rested from secular labours and
celebrated the public services of religion upon the original
Sabbath, the seventh day of the week, which has ever since
been observed by their descendants.</p>

<p>In 1728, they resolved themselves into an ecclesiastical
body, and a monastic society was instituted in 1732, for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">{218}</a></span>
the accommodation of which suitable buildings were erected.
Other buildings were likewise erected by the community,
and all together constituted the irregular, yet lovely village
of Ephrata. Both men and women were admitted into the
convent, and both appear to have been singularly attached
to the monastic state. They wore the habit of the Capuchins,
or White Friars, which consisted of a shirt, trowsers
and vest, with a long white gown and cowl, of woollen
web in winter, and linen in the summer. That of the
sisters differed only in the substitution of skirts for trowsers,
and some slight peculiarities in the form of the cap. All
who entered the cloister received monastic names. Their
first Prior was Onesimus, (Israel Eckerlin,) who was succeeded
by Peter Miller, surnamed Jabez. Beissel, whose
monastic name was Friedsam, received the title of Father—spiritual
father,—and subsequently that of Gottrecht,
implying together, Peaceable God-right, from the brethren
of the community. "In the year 1740, there were
thirty-six single brethren in the cloister, and thirty-five
sisters; and at one time the society, including the members
living in the neighbourhood, amounted to near three hundred."
The government and arrangement of this little
community were perfectly republican, and all the members
stood upon the most fraternal equality and freedom. They
were bound by no vows, neither had they any written covenant.
The New Testament was their confession of faith,
their code of laws, and their rule of discipline. Such property
as accumulated with the society, by donation and
from the labour of the single brethren and sisters, was held
as common stock, but none were obliged to devote their
personal property to this purpose or to resign any of their
temporal possessions. A considerable income was derived
from the farm, which, with the proceeds of the grist-mill,
paper-mill, oil-mill, fulling-mill, and the industry of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">{219}</a></span>
brethren and sisters, sufficed to support the society in a
comfortable manner.</p>

<p>The principles of this society appear to have been superficially
understood and partially represented by most
writers upon the subject, although there is nothing about
them mysterious or intricate.</p>

<p>"They receive the Bible as the only rule of faith, covenant,
and code of laws for church government. They do
not admit the least license with the letter and spirit of the
Scripture, especially with the New Testament, do not
allow one tittle to be added or rejected in the administration
of the ordinances, but practise them precisely as they
are instituted and made an example by Jesus Christ in his
word.</p>

<p>"They believe in the divinity of our Lord Jesus Christ,
and the trinity of the Godhead; having unfurled this distinctive
banner on the first page of a hymn book which
they had printed for the society as early as 1739, viz.:
'There are three that bear record in heaven, the Father,
the Word, and the Holy Ghost; and these three are one.
And there are three that bear witness on earth, the Spirit,
and the water, and the blood; and these three agree in
one.'</p>

<p>"They believe that salvation is of grace, and not of
works; and they rely solely on the merits and atonement
of Christ. They believe, also, that that atonement is
sufficient for every creature; that Christ died for all who
will call upon his name, and offer fruits meet for repentance;
and that all who come to Christ are drawn of the
Father.</p>

<p>"They contend for the observance of the original Sabbath,
believing that it requires an authority equal to that of the
Great Institutor to change any of his decrees. They maintain,
that as he blessed and sanctified that day for ever, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">{220}</a></span>
has never been abrogated in his word, nor any scripture to
be found to warrant that construction; it is still as binding
as it was when it was reiterated amid the thunders of
Mount Sinai. To alter so positive and hallowed a commandment
of the Almighty, they consider would require
an explicit edict from the Great Jehovah. It was not
foretold by any of the prophets, that with the new dispensation
there would be any change in the Sabbath or any
of the commandments. Christ, who declared himself the
Lord of the Sabbath, observed the seventh day, and made
it the day for his special ministrations; nor did he authorize
any change. The Apostles have not assumed to do
away the original Sabbath, or give any command to substitute
the first for the seventh day.</p>

<p>"They hold to Apostolic baptism—and administer trine
immersion, with the laying on of hands and prayer while
the recipient yet remains kneeling in the water.</p>

<p>"They celebrate the Lord's Supper at night, washing,
at the same time, each other's feet, agreeably to his
command and example. This is attended to in the
evening after the close of the Sabbath—the Sabbath
terminating at sunset of the seventh day; thus making
the supper an imitation of that instituted by Christ, and
resembling also the meeting of the Apostles on the first
day to break bread, which has produced much confusion
in some minds in regard to the proper day to be observed."</p>

<p>Although celibacy was neither enforced nor required, it
was considered a virtue. There was no prohibition of marriage
or of legalized sexual intercourse, as many writers
have erroneously stated, but when two concluded to be
joined in wedlock, they were assisted by the society. They
conceived with Paul, whose opinion and practice does not
find many clerical imitators at the present day, that celibacy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">{221}</a></span>
was more conducive to a holy life. There are many passages
of Scripture to that effect, which they, unlike the
ministers of other Protestant denominations, kept in perpetual
remembrance. "He that is unmarried, careth for
the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the
Lord; but he that is married careth for the things of the
world, how he may please his wife. There is this difference
between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth
for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in
body and in spirit; but she that is married careth for the
things of the world, how she may please her husband. I
say therefore to the unmarried and widows, it is good for
them if they abide even as I." They likewise, and, in my
opinion, truly considered that those who sacrificed conjugal
endearments for Christ's sake, were better fitted for, and
will enjoy the highest places in glory. Hear the sublime
language of the Revelator: "I looked up, and lo, a Lamb
stood on Mount Zion, and with him an hundred and forty
and four thousand, having his Father's name written in
their foreheads. And I heard a voice from heaven as the
voice of many waters, and as the voice of a great thunder;
and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps;
and they sung as it were a new song before the throne,
and before the four beasts and the elders; and no man
could learn that song but the hundred and forty and four
thousand, which were redeemed from the earth. These are
they that are not defiled with women; for they are virgins.
These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he
goeth. These were redeemed from among men, being the
first fruits unto God and the Lamb." This idea was fondly
cherished, and continually inculcated. It formed the foundation
of the monastic institution at Ephrata, whose support
and prosperity was entirely dependent on its being
properly appreciated. It formed the subject of many an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">{222}</a></span>
eloquent harangue, the theme of many a pleasant song,
the object around which the holiest memories gathered, and
with which the sweetest associations were combined. It
was sedulously kept before them by their ministers and
teachers in its most favourable light, and all the scripture
susceptible of this application, which was not a little, was
brought to excite their enthusiasm, and to inspire them
with faithfulness and perseverance. It promised capabilities
for the divine life which others could not possess,
and held out to their enraptured imaginations the brighter
rewards of heaven.</p>

<p>Their ministers never received a stated salary. In their
opinion the Gospel was destined to be free, "without money
and without price," and they thought that every one called
to preach the word, should do it from the love of the cause,
and in this matter, as in that of celibacy, to follow the
advice and example of Paul. Nevertheless, their ministers
were always well supplied with such necessaries as the
brethren themselves enjoyed. Individual members gave
as presents whatever they could conveniently spare, in
money, goods, and the like; and whenever the minister
travelled for religious purposes, he was supplied from the
treasury to bear his expenses.</p>

<p>This is not the place, neither am I disposed to institute
any comparison between the doctrines of the Scripture,
according to its literal interpretation, and the great and
leading tenets of the German Seventh-day Baptists of
Pennsylvania. However, it is evident, from the most
casual observation, that few religious communities have
adhered more closely to the letter and language of Holy
Writ, have been more scrupulous about conformity to
worldly opinions and practices, or have given, in their
conduct, a more faithful and practical exemplification of
Christianity. Their peculiarities sprung, likewise, from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">{223}</a></span>
the same source as many of their virtues; and these will
be adverted to in replying to the charges of error which
have been urged against them, with more gravity than
truth, by many writers, who were, probably, offended by
the pure and primitive simplicity of their tenets and habits.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to attempt a full exposition of their
peculiar views, or to describe the minutiæ of the manner
in which they perform the ceremonies and ordinances of
religion. However, in their regular worship, they commence
with singing; then prayers, the assembly kneeling;
then singing again; after which the minister requests any
brother to read a chapter out of the Scriptures, which they
are at liberty to choose from either the Old or the New
Testament. This the minister expounds, tracing its bearings
and historical connexions with the other parts of the
Bible. Then the exhorters enforce the duties it inculcates;
and should any brother or single sister be able to improve
the subject to the edification of the others, or to make any
remarks relative to the topic, there is perfect liberty for
such an expression. Prayer and singing, with the reading
of a psalm, conclude the service,—than which nothing can
be more solemn and impressive.</p>

<p>Ignorance, in a writer, is nearly or quite as culpable as
misrepresentation; for no one has any right to assume the
responsibilities of the historian, without first making himself
the master of his subject. By a contrary course, he
may inadvertently expose the most innocent and virtuous
community to the reprobation and ridicule of contemporaries,
and the abhorrence of posterity. Few societies
have suffered more in their reputation from ignorant and
unprincipled authors, than the society of Ephrata; others,
however, have borne honourable testimony to its merits.</p>

<p>The account of their sentiments in Buck's Theological
Dictionary, is a tissue of misrepresentation and calumny,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">{224}</a></span>
unworthy a place in such a work. We are there told that
their "principal tenets appear to be these: that future
happiness is only obtained by penance and outward mortification
in this life; and that Jesus Christ, by his meritorious
sufferings, became the Redeemer of mankind in
general, so that each individual of the human race, by a
life of abstinence and restraint, may work out his own
salvation. Nay, they go so far as to admit of works of
supererogation, and declare that a man may do much more
than he is in justice or equity bound to do, and that his
superabundant works may therefore be applied to the salvation
of others." This, as well as the accounts given of
them in many other English books, is a gross falsehood.
Gordon's Gazetteer of Pennsylvania is almost equally
reprehensible, as the account which it contains was first
published by the Historical Society of Pennsylvania, and
contains many erroneous charges, that are entirely without
foundation, and could only have originated in gross ignorance
or shameful wickedness. Among other misrepresentations,
the good and devout founder is declared to have
been a crafty and designing usurper of ecclesiastical authority,
and as assuming honours and titles. These statements
are utterly unfounded. Beissel had been educated
in the Calvinistic faith, but perceiving its dissimilarity to
the word of God, as respects church government, ministerial
salaries, and other things of a like nature, he emigrated
to America in order to enjoy liberty of conscience,
and he left the society of Dunkers at Mill Creek, because
his peculiarities relative to the Sabbath created some dissension.
It is true that he was drawn from his seclusion,
but it is no less true, that the people whom he had forsaken,
sought him out and came and settled around him, entreating
his ministry. After this time he devoted his whole
time, life, and property to advance the welfare of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">{225}</a></span>
society, giving the management of the secular affairs
entirely into the hands of others, while he gave his attention
wholly to instructing the people in the word of life.
The doctrine of celibacy which he taught was no new-fangled
idea, being quite as old as the time of the Apostle
Paul. He received the title of "Father," and "Gottrecht,"
from the brethren, instead of presumptuously assuming them
himself.</p>

<p>In their habits of life, they have been equally misrepresented.
They are not accustomed to wear long beards, as
is frequently said of them, neither did the rules of the
society forbid meat for the purpose of mortifying the
natural appetite, or require them to repose on wooden
benches with billets of wood for pillows, as acts of penance.
Nevertheless they did so, but their conduct admits of a
different explanation. They practised austerity from considerations
of economy. With limited means and restricted
circumstances they had undertaken an expensive enterprise.
Hence, all their arrangements, though distinguished for
neatness, were extremely simple. Wooden flagons, wooden
goblets, and wooden trays were used in the administration of
the sacrament, and although they have been presented with
richer and costlier ones, the same service is still in use.
Their domestic and kitchen utensils were likewise made of
wood. The plates off which they ate, were thin octangular
pieces of poplar boards. Their forks and candlesticks, and
indeed every article that could be, were made of that material.
Subsequently, when they were relieved from the
burdens of their expensive enterprise, they generally enjoyed
the cot for nightly repose, and partook, though in
the most moderate and temperate manner, of the comforts,
and even some of the luxuries of life. Temperance societies
had not been instituted, "but there were no ardent spirits
used in building the whole village, although the timber
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">{226}</a></span>
was hewn and all the boards sawn by hand during the
winter months." The society was a social community,
organized for mutual support and assistance. Its members
were distinguished for kindness, hospitality, and promptness
in affording relief to the suffering, whatever might be their
character or denomination. The following account of them
is taken from a work, entitled the Journal of an Officer,
which was published in 1784. He says, "I came among
this people by accident, but I left them with regret. I
have found out, however, that appearances may be delusive,
and that where we expected to meet with a cold
reservedness, we may sometimes be surprised by exhibitions
of the most charming affability and disinterested
benevolence. They all acted the part of the good Samaritan
to me, for which I hope to be ever grateful; and while
experiencing the benefits of their kindnesses and attentions,
witnessing the sympathies and emotions expressed in their
countenances, and listening to the words of hope and pity
with which they consoled the poor sufferers, is it strange
that, under such circumstances, their uncouth garments
appeared more beautiful in my eyes than ever did the
richest robes of fashion, and their cowls more becoming
than head-dresses adorned with diamonds, and flowers, and
feathers? Until I entered the walls of Ephrata, I had no
idea of pure and practical Christianity. Not that I was
ignorant of the forms, or even of the doctrines of religion.
I knew it in theory before; I saw it in practice then.</p>

<p>"Many a poor wounded soldier will carry to his grave
the sweet remembrance of those gentle sisters, who watched
so patiently by his side, supported his fainting head, administered
the healing draught, and cheered him with both
earthly and heavenly hopes. What mattered it to him that
their words were couched in an unknown dialect; he read
their meaning in the deep, earnest, liquid eyes. Eternity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">{227}</a></span>
likewise will bear a glorious testimony to the labour of the
Prior, who could converse in the English language. Many
a poor fellow, who entered there profane, immoral, and
without hope or God in the world, left it rejoicing in the
Saviour."</p>

<p>This officer had been wounded in the battle of Brandywine,
and had been, with many of his comrades, despatched to
the hospital at Ephrata. I shall allude to this circumstance
again. Morgan Edwards bears the following testimony of
this people.</p>

<p>"From their recluse and ascetic habits, sour aspects
and rough manners might be expected; but on the contrary,
a smiling innocence and meekness grace their
countenances, and a softness of tone and accent adorns their
conversation, and makes their deportment gentle and obliging.
Their singing is charming, partly owing to the
pleasantness of their voices, the variety of the parts they
carry on together, and the devout manner of the performance."
The following character of Beissel is derived from
the same source.</p>

<p>"He was very strict in his morals, and practised self-denial
to an uncommon degree. Enthusiastic and whimsical
he certainly was, but an apparent devoutness and
sincerity ran through all his oddities. He was not an
adept in any of the liberal arts and sciences except music,
in which he excelled. He composed and set to music, in
two, four, five and seven parts, a volume of hymns, and
another of anthems. He left behind him several books in
manuscript, curiously written and embellished, and likewise
published several other works." One writer has observed,
"that the sisters apparently took little delight in their
state of single blessedness, as two only, (aged and ill-favoured
ones, we may suppose,) remained steadfast in the
renunciation of marriage." This invidious remark is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">{228}</a></span>
entirely unfounded; for though they were not required to
renounce matrimony on entering the cloister, only four or
five of the whole number that were received in it as inmates,
during the period of one hundred and ten years, left and
were married. One of these became the wife of a gentleman
of Philadelphia, and afterwards, amid the cares and
burdens of a large family, she regretted her change exceedingly,
as did all the others who were induced to leave the
"stille einsamkeit." "The others remained steadfast in
their state of single blessedness, and now, with the exception
of those remaining in the convent, lie beside each other in
the beautiful cemetery in the foreground of the village."
These gratuitous aspersions would be passed over with the
silence they deserve, were it not that a fresh currency has
been given to them by a late popular work. They have
likewise been charged with denying the doctrine of original
sin, and the eternity of punishment. They do not indeed
believe that every individual of mankind is included in the
condemnation of Adam, for many who are born, die without
sinning; but they admit that in the fall of Adam, all disposition
to good was lost, and "that the whole race inherit
a natural innate depravity, which will lead them to sin, and
prove their sure condemnation, unless they repent and are
born again of the Holy Spirit." Beissel wrote a most curious
and ingenious treatise upon this subject, in which he
enters into long disquisitions on the nature and intellectual
capabilities of Adam in his primeval state of innocence.
He then explains in what manner he was affected by the
fall, and with it elucidates many passages of scripture,
which have escaped the attention of men of more erudition,
but less profundity of penetration and genius. His views,
however, though deep and ingenious, are somewhat mysterious,
and would, in the present day, be considered as
little better than the hypothetical speculations of an overwrought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">{229}</a></span>
imagination. However, there is nothing that can be
construed as denying the doctrine of human depravity, and
the woeful consequences that the fall of Adam has entailed
upon his posterity, unless each one be regenerated by the
sanctifying influences of the Spirit of Grace. They never
received the doctrine of universal salvation in the usual
acceptation of that term. They believe in the sure reward
of submission and obedience to the requisitions of God,
through faith in Christ, but they teach likewise, that the
"wages of sin is death," death to holiness, and exclusion
from the joys of heaven and the presence of the Lord.
It is not to be denied that the idea of a universal restoration
of all things was cherished by some of them in
former days, and that it was based upon several passages
of Scripture, particularly the fifteenth chapter of the first
epistle to the Corinthians, and the twentieth chapter of
the Revelations. Nevertheless it was never taught as a
doctrine, but was treated with the greatest caution and
delicacy by the pastor, and aged members, in private circles,
and was always accompanied by expressions of the
necessity of making their calling and election sure, that
thereby they might be prepared to participate in the first
resurrection. Many of the brethren were no less distinguished
for high literary attainments than for piety, and
they established a school at a very early period which
afforded every facility for the acquisition of classical and
scientific education, and which gained for itself so honourable
a reputation, that many young men from the first
families of Baltimore and Philadelphia were sent here to
be educated. A Sabbath school was likewise instituted,
which afforded the best facilities for moral and religious
instruction. It flourished many years, and was attended
by important consequences. The minds of the juvenile
population were excited to a state of religious inquiry,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">{230}</a></span>
which increased to what would be termed, in these days, a
powerful revival, accompanied by the most intense excitement.
The scholars met together, before and after
common school hours, for prayer and exhortation, but
their zeal, at least in the minds of the older brethren,
ran into excess, which induced Beissel to discourage the
enterprise, and also to object to the erection of a building,
which was already commenced, for the especial use of the
school, to be called Succoth. This Sabbath school had
been instituted under the following circumstances. Ludwig
Hœcker, or Brother Obed, as he was designated, who was
the teacher of the common school, perceiving that many
of the indigent children were kept from regular attendance
by necessary employments during the week, projected the
plan of holding a school in the afternoon of the Sabbath,
where instruction would be administered to those of all
circumstances. It is not known, neither is it material, in
what year the Sabbath school was commenced. Hœcker
took up his residence at Ephrata in the year 1739, and it
is presumed that he commenced the enterprise soon after.
By reference to the minutes of the Society, we find that
the materials for the building were provided in 1749.
After the battle of Brandywine, the Sabbath school-room,
with others, was turned into a hospital, which it continued
to be for some time. The school thus broken up, was
never afterwards resumed. The honour of having projected
and successfully introduced the present general system of
Sunday School instruction, is certainly due to Robert
Raikes; but the Seventh-day Baptists of Ephrata had
established and maintained in operation for upwards of
thirty years, a Sabbath school, nearly half a century before
one was opened by the Gloucester philanthropist.</p>

<p>In 1777, the Society began to decline, but the declension
cannot justly be attributed to the causes which some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">{231}</a></span>
writers have erroneously stated. Beissel died in 1768, and
his successor, Peter Miller, was a man of much higher attainments
and more eminent mental powers. Indeed, Miller
had the principal management of the establishment during
Beissel's time, and to his extraordinary abilities the early
prosperity of the institution is mainly imputable. Its decline,
however, can be rationally accounted for, without
supposing either incapability or degeneracy in those who
were intrusted with the direction of its affairs, especially
when we take into consideration the great changes in politics
and government that transpired, and the consequent
alterations in public sentiment. The seventeenth century
was prolific in monastic institutions, of which this was one;
and the feelings and motives that animated its founders
were decidedly European. During the first fifty years
from the establishment of Ephrata, a remarkable progress
was made in liberal opinions, and with the march of intellect
and politics, different opinions with regard to religious
institutions were also entertained. It was commenced as
a social community, and as such it succeeded admirably,
and was adapted to every purpose of life, when surrounded
by a howling wilderness, filled with wild beasts, and wilder
inhabitants; but when the hand of improvement had turned
the forests into fields smiling with plenty, and the neighbouring
country became filled with a dense and promiscuous
population, it appeared evident to all that it was not compatible
with the circumstances of the times, or the spirit
of the age. Besides this, its members were exposed to incessant
persecutions, and were kept in perpetual contentions
and turmoils by their envious neighbours, which, of
themselves, were enough to have produced a declension in
the Society.</p>

<p>The community at Ephrata still comprises a small band
who retain the principles and manners of their forefathers,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">{232}</a></span>
and who meet regularly to worship God on the evenings
and mornings of their Sabbaths. But although they have
the forms, they are without the spirit or the zeal of their
ancestors. In ancient times they had bestowed upon them
in ridicule the epithet of "Zealots." Zeal, however, when
it is according to knowledge, is commendable; under any
circumstances it is preferable to indifference. Christianity
without zeal is like the body without life, and it is an
honour to any denomination to receive, even in ridicule, a
title designative of faithfulness and activity. Ephrata
would be a paradise now as it was in former days, did its
inhabitants possess, in the same degree, that desirable
quality which those of old possessed, and for which they
were stigmatized. Yet in this zeal there was neither noise
nor display. It was not the occasional gleam of the meteor,
but the pure, steady, unchangeable light of the pole-star,
so quiet and all-absorbing, in which the world, with its
pomps and vanities, was sacrificed upon the altar of pure
and constant devotion. They lived and moved in the
world, performed the routine of all the duties devolving
upon them, and cherished the highest and holiest affections;
but their treasures and their hearts were centred in heaven.
Could they stoop to quaff from the springs of earth, who
had once slaked their thirst at the fountains of immortality?
could those ears be delighted with terrestrial songs,
that had once been ravished by the unimaginable harmonics
of the upper world? How would they thirst and long for
another draught! How would they wait and listen to catch
another echo! And how would the ignorant world deride
their enthusiasm and mock their zeal! Of those who, at
Ephrata, were derided as zealots and enthusiasts, Mr.
Winchester makes the following declaration: "God will
always have a visible people upon earth, and these (speaking
of the Society at Ephrata), are his people at present,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">{233}</a></span>
above any other in the world. They walk in all the commandments
and ordinances of the Lord blameless, both in
public and private. They bring up their children (alluding
to the married members), in the nurture and admonition
of the Lord; no noise, rudeness, shameless mirth, loud
laughter, is heard within their doors. The law of kindness
is in their mouths; no sourness or moroseness disgraces
their religion, and whatsoever they believe their
Saviour teaches, they practise, without inquiring or regarding
what others do. They read much; they sing and
pray much; they are constant attendants upon the worship
of God; their dwelling-houses are all houses of prayer."</p>

<p>Although Ephrata has degenerated—is now spiritually
dead—the truth has not become extinct, but is still extending.
From this parent society several branches have
originated. One in Bedford County was founded in 1753,
which is still in a flourishing situation. Another in York
County, about fifteen miles from the town of York, was
founded on the Bermudian Creek, in 1758, of which some
of the members remain, although they have been without
a leader for many years. A third branch was established
at Snowhill, in Franklin County, under the superintendence
of Peter Lehman and Andrew Snowberger, where the
greatest part of the Society are still resident. Besides
these, there are other smaller branches in Western Pennsylvania.</p>

<h3>SECTION III.<br />
<small>PARTICULAR HISTORY OF THE GERMAN SEVENTH-DAY BAPTISTS OF PENNSYLVANIA.</small></h3>

</div>

<p>Ephrata is located in the interior of the state of Pennsylvania,
and is one of its earliest settlements. Few places
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">{234}</a></span>
in America are hallowed by more interesting associations,
and none perhaps are connected with an institution of such
a peculiar character and ancient establishment. It occupies
a pleasant position in Cocalico Township, Lancaster
County, at the intersection of the Reading Road with the
Downingtown and Harrisburg Turnpike, sixty miles northwest
of Philadelphia, thirteen northeast from Lancaster,
and thirty-eight from Harrisburg. At present this name
is applied to the vicinity of Ephrata proper for at least a
mile along the turnpike, making Cocalico Creek the centre.
Thus considered, it contains many dwellings, several stores,
two taverns, and a paper mill. New Ephrata is a small
village, about a mile further west on the turnpike.</p>

<p>Ephrata proper is an irregular enclosed village, lying in
a triangle formed by the turnpike, the old Reading Road,
and the Cocalico Creek, and belongs entirely to a Seventh-day
Baptist community. It contains the first Protestant
monastery established in America, and several other buildings
for the accommodation of the Society; to which is
attached and belongs a farm containing one hundred and
forty acres of land, with a grist and saw mill. The post-office
bearing this name is situated half a mile from the
original village.</p>

<p>Kedar and Zion, a meeting-house and convent, were the
first buildings of consequence erected by the Society. They
were located in a pleasant situation, on a hill called Mount
Zion. In the meadow below, larger accommodations were
subsequently erected, comprising a sisters' house, called
Saron, to which a large chapel is attached, with a "Saal,"
where are held the Agapas or love-feasts. They likewise
erected a brothers' house, called Bethania, with which was
connected the large meeting-room with galleries, in which
the whole Society assembled for public worship, in the
times of their prosperity. These edifices are still standing,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">{235}</a></span>
surrounded by smaller buildings, which were occupied as
a printing-office, school-house, bake-house, almonry, and
others for different useful purposes, on one of which the
town clock is erected. These buildings are all of singular
character, and very ancient architecture, all the outside
walls being covered with shingles. The two houses
for the brethren and sisters are large and commodious,
being three or four stories high. Each contains an apartment
particularly appropriated to their night meetings,
and the main buildings are divided into small compartments,
of which each building contains fifty or sixty. The
rooms are so arranged, that six dormitories, which are
barely large enough to contain a cot, a closet, and an hourglass,
surround one of larger dimensions, in which each
subdivision pursued their respective avocations. These
silent cells and long winding passages possess an indescribably
romantic air; and one can scarcely divest himself of
the belief that he is threading the tortuous windings of
some old baronial castle. The ceilings have an elevation
of about seven feet; the passages leading to the cells, or
"kammers," as they are designated, and through the
different parts of both convents, are barely wide enough to
admit one person, and if two should meet from opposite
directions, one would invariably be obliged to retreat. The
doors of the kammers are five feet high, and twenty inches
wide; and the windows, of which each contains but one,
is only eighteen by twenty-four inches. The walls of all
these rooms, including the public meeting-room, the private
chapels, the saals, and the dormitories, are nearly covered
with ink paintings, or, in other words, with large sheets of
elegant penmanship. Some of these are texts from the
Scriptures, handsomely done in ornamented Gothic letters,
called in the German, "Fractur-schrifften."</p>

<p>The sheets of paper employed for this purpose were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">{236}</a></span>
manufactured at their own mill, and some being put into
frames, admonish the residents, as well as the casual visiter,
whichever way they may turn their heads. Two very
curious ones still remain in the chapel attached to Saron.
One represents the straight and narrow way, which it
would be difficult to describe. It is very curiously and
ingeniously formed on a sheet of about three feet square,
the whole of the road being filled with texts of Scripture,
reminding the disciples of their duties, and the obligations
their profession imposes upon them.</p>

<p>Another is a representation of the three heavens. In
the first, Christ, the Good Shepherd, is represented as
calling his flock together; in the second, which is one foot
in height, and three feet wide, three hundred figures in the
Capuchin dress appear with harps in their hands, and
behind them the heads of an innumerable host; in the third
is seen the throne of glory surrounded by two hundred
archangels. Many of these "Fractur schrifften" express
the most enthusiastic sentiments on the subject of celibacy,
and the happiness of a recluse life, whilst others are devotional
pieces. The following are transcribed from two
found in the chapel of the sister's convent:</p>

<p>In the rooms which have been occupied by any departed
sister, a piece, in imitation of a tablet, is framed and put
up, expressive of the character and virtues of the deceased,
or some feeling memorial of love, and pious anticipation of
meeting again in heaven, is inscribed. The following was
found in the kammer which had been occupied by Zenobia,
a very beautiful, amiable, and devout sister.</p>

<p class="small">Zenobia Wird Gruenen und Gedeihen, ihre Arbeit wird
nicht vergeblich, noch auch ihre Hoffnung verlohren seyn, ihre Ehre
bluehen mitten unter den Heiligen.</p>

<p class="small">Zenobia will prosper and flourish. Her labours will not
be useless, nor her hopes vain. Her glory will be revealed in heaven.</p>

<p>An apartment, denominated the writing-room, was particularly
appropriated to such purposes, and several of the
sisters devoted their whole attention to this labour, and
became highly skilled in it. Others transcribed the writings
of the Founder of the Society, thus multiplying copies for
the wants of the community, before their printing press
came into operation. Two very ingenious sisters, named
Anastasia and Iphigenia, were the principal ornamental
writers. They formed, with immense labour, a large folio
volume of "sample alphabets" of various sizes and different
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">{238}</a></span>
styles, though all are alike curious, and exhibit the most
patient application. The letters of the first alphabet are
one foot in length, surrounded by a deep border, in imitation
of copperplate engraving, of which each one is different
in style and finish. It was finished in the year 1750, and
is still preserved as a rare curiosity, by the trustees.</p>

<p>Another room was exclusively set apart for the purposes
of transcribing music; hundreds of volumes, each volume
containing five or six hundred pieces, were transferred from
book to book, with almost as much neatness and quite as
much accuracy, as if done with a graver.</p>

<p>The Society at Ephrata, after their printing press came
into operation, published several valuable historical and
religious books. Of these, an edition of the "Bloody
Theatre," an old German work, was nearly all taken by
the American army for cartridges. Several of the members
were decided literary characters of no mean ability.<span class="fnanchor"><a
name="Ref_43" id="Ref_43" href="#Foot_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>At one time it was in contemplation by three brothers,
named Eckerlin, of whom the eldest was prior, and had the
superintendence of the secular concerns, to make Ephrata
a place of more importance in the world than it could acquire
from its character of a religious refuge. They were
natives of Germany, and they had been educated in the
principles of the Catholic faith. They projected the plan
of erecting extensive buildings for manufacturing purposes,
and of entering into extensive mercantile concerns. For
this they had made considerable preparation, such as
cutting and hewing the timbers, and were in readiness to
erect a town. They had likewise sent to Europe, where
they had extensive and powerful connexions, and procured,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">{239}</a></span>
unknown to the Society, a chime of bells, and likewise a
large clock for the tower. These arrived in Philadelphia,
and the bill requiring payment being forwarded to the
Society, made the brotherhood acquainted with the circumstances.
They determined not to receive them, but had
them sold, and paid the loss. One of these bells, having
upon it, "Sub auspicicio viri venerandi Onesimi societatis
Ephratensis præpositi," was purchased for, and is now on,
one of the churches in Lancaster. The clock was sold
to one of the Reformed Lutheran societies in the same
place. This transaction led to an investigation of the conduct
of the Eckerlins, which resulted in the timely discovery
of a conspiracy they had entered into to possess themselves
of the property, which at that time was extensive and
valuable. This discovery terminated in the expulsion of
Israel, the prior, from his office. The brothers subsequently
removed to Virginia, where they obtained considerable
notoriety in connexion with Indian affairs. The
Society, in its apostolic simplicity, desired no tower, no
bells. They even refused to have a bell to summon them
to the midnight meeting, which was regularly held at that
hour of the night,—Beissel quaintly observing, that the
spirit of devotion ought to be sufficient to insure their
attendance; and it generally proved to be adequate.</p>

<p>The community at Ephrata were decided Whigs in the
Revolution, although they considered contention with arms
and at law as inconsistent with the Christian character and
profession. In the war of 1756, the doors of the cloister,
including the meeting-room, the chapels, and every other
building, were opened to afford a refuge to the inhabitants
of Tulpehocken and the Paxton settlements, then
on the frontiers, as they fled before the murdering and
marauding bands of Indians; and all were kept and fed
by the Society during the period of alarm and danger.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">{240}</a></span>
Upon hearing of this the royal government despatched
from Philadelphia a company of infantry to protect and
defend the place; and becoming aware of the character of
the Society, presented them with a pair of large and beautiful
communion goblets, which was the only recompense
they could be prevailed on to receive. At a much earlier
period they attracted the attention of the Penn family,
and Lady Juliana Penn, in England, opened a correspondence
with the Society. Governor Penn visited them frequently,
and being desirous to bestow upon them a solid
evidence of his regard, had a large tract of five thousand
acres of land surveyed and conveyed to them as the
Seventh-day Baptist Manor. This, however, they refused
to accept, believing that large possessions tended to engender
strife, and that it was inconsistent with the Christian
character to be absorbed in the gains of this world
and the accumulation of temporal property.</p>

<p>A few days after the battle of Brandywine, Sept. 11th,
1777, the whole establishment was opened to receive the
wounded Americans, great numbers of whom were brought
there in wagons, a distance of forty miles; and that long
train of various conveyances, that came slowly up the valley
where the field had been contested—the train that bore those
whose shattered limbs seemed to defy all surgical aid, or whose
contagious disease was like the pestilence that wasteth at
noonday, was received by the brothers of Ephrata as if it
bore forward the gathered harvest of summer. And those
sisters,—did they shrink from that dreadful exhibition of
human suffering? did they turn pale, and sicken at
the view of bruised and mangled limbs, clotted gore, and
the sound of deep heart-rending groans? Oh no; their
sympathy was of the practical kind. It prompted them to
assuage and relieve. And with the kindest and tenderest
feelings they garnered up the sick, the wounded, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">{241}</a></span>
dying, in their rooms, their chapels, and their edifices, devoted
to public worship or domestic duties, with a welcome
and care that only religion could dictate, and that only
true patriotism could have evinced. Of the five hundred
who were brought there one hundred and fifty died, notwithstanding
the attendance of Doctors Scott, Yerkel, and
Harrison. The dead were buried with all the decencies of
friendship, and with all the ceremonies of military propriety.
They were principally from the Eastern States
and Pennsylvania. The place where they lay is enclosed;
and in the autumn of 1845, the corner stone of a
monument, bearing a suitable inscription, was laid by
Governor Shunk, in presence of a great multitude of
people who had assembled to witness the ceremonies. In
the burying-ground which belongs to the Society are the
tombs of the ancient fathers, with suitable marble monuments
erected to their memories. A large stone, marked
with German letters, covers the grave of their founder.</p>

<p>At present many of the buildings are in ruins, particularly
those which were first erected. A short distance
from the enclosure containing the old meeting-house and
cloister, there is a small building, with a steeple, which was
formerly the residence of the physician. Near by stands
another dwelling, which was the parsonage. Above this
stands a large building. Without, it presents a very singular
and unique appearance. In entering it we pass a small
portico, and the door is so low that it is necessary to stoop
in passing; but the objects within witness at once to the
vision that it is the house of God. Six tables are arranged
so as to reach nearly the whole length of the room, with
convenient seats, as many as are necessary. On one side
of the room appear a stand and table, slightly elevated, for
the accommodation of the speaker. Several of those large
ornamented writings, already described, are hanging on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">{242}</a></span>
the walls. The room is perhaps forty feet square. It was
formerly the sisters' dining and prayer room. At present
it is the meeting-room of the Society. A part of the same
building is used for domestic and culinary purposes, and
is furnished accordingly. Near this is a stone building
appropriated to other domestic offices. The house at present
occupied by the sisters is contiguous to the meeting-room,
and is inhabited by five aged ladies, who are the only
remaining members of the convent. They have many relics
of antiquity, which are preserved as objects of curiosity.
Some of the caps worn by the sisters in the early days of
the institution are carefully preserved. Adjoining the
turnpike, in a corner of the yard, stands the academy,—a
new building, with a steeple, clock, and bell. It is two
stories high, and contains several apartments, in which
both male and female schools are taught. These buildings,
with one hundred and twenty acres of land, and a grist and
saw mill, are the property of the Society.</p>

<p>Another community, every way similar to that of Ephrata,
is situated at Snowhill, in Franklin County, Pennsylvania.
Its location is in that beautiful and fertile valley which is
embosomed in the Blue Ridge Mountains, extending from
Northern Pennsylvania to the Shenandoah Valley, in Virginia.
This section was early settled by a German population,
and their immediate neighbourhood with the Dunker
Baptists, of which there is now a large society. Belonging
to this Dunker Society was one Andrew Snowberger, from
whom the Snowhill Society takes its cognomen, berg, in
German, signifying a hill,—his name is literally Snowhills.
It is seldom, however, that adventitious names correspond
with localities. The establishment called Snowhill is located
in a small vale of a large valley, in latitude 39° N., about
seven miles from Hagerstown, Maryland. In the convent
resided an old sister, in 1849, nearly one hundred years of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">{243}</a></span>
age, who was the daughter of Andrew Snowberger, and
who gave the following account of the origin of the Society.
Her father, by a diligent study of his German Bible, became
convinced that the seventh day of the week was the
only divinely appointed Sabbath, and in consequence he
became firmly determined to keep it as holy time. This
caused much difficulty in his family and among his neighbours;
but he was not to be deterred from acting according
to the dictates of his conscience by any difficulties.
Believing in prayer, and that faith and patience will overcome
all things, he persevered in the path of duty. At
length, to his inexpressible delight, the way became smooth
before him, his family complied with his regulations, and
subsequently embraced his views. In this lonely situation
as to society of his own faith, Andrew instituted and maintained
the worship of God in his own house. He desired
to remain in communion with his first-day brethren, but
they, after a long consideration of the subject, determined
upon his expulsion from the church. This, to his feelingly
sensitive mind, was extremely painful; but he observed,
"that he could better bear the frown and disowning of
men, than to disobey God and feel that he incurred His
displeasure."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the many trials and difficulties, Andrew
continued firm in his attachment to the Sabbath, and some
time after, his faith was greatly increased by the following
circumstance. The country, in many parts, was still a
dense and unbroken forest, and much of the labour of these
early settlers was to clear away the superabundant wood.
In this employment Andrew was engaged one first-day,
when his neighbours were all gone to the Dunker meeting.
He was piling and burning brush, which, at that time,
formed the material of all the fences, upon his own and
the contiguous estates. After he had been at work for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">{244}</a></span>
some time, the wind rose to a smart breeze, and the fires
in a very few minutes became unmanageable. On they
went, crackling and roaring; the fence on one side of the
lot took fire, whence it spread with rapidity, and was in a
fair way to communicate to the home establishment of his
neighbour. Andrew saw plainly enough that notwithstanding
all his efforts to the contrary, the whole must
inevitably be burned before human help could be obtained,
unless Providence would interpose. In this extremity he
threw himself upon his knees, his face and hands blackened
with smoke and ashes, and cried out in the deepest tones of
supplication, "Oh Lord, if it be from thee that I keep the
seventh day for a Sabbath, and labour on this day, according
to thy law, do thou stop this fire." While he thus
prayed the wind veered suddenly, and took the fire in altogether
another direction, so that it became easily manageable.
The skeptic may sneer at this, but the Christian
will remember that God is omniscient, that He holds the
winds in his fist, and moreover that He has promised to
hear and answer prayer. This remarkable circumstance
Andrew improved, by vowing unto the Lord to be steadfast
in his law, and to make his house for ever a house
devoted to the servants and the service of God,—a vow
which the Almighty seems to this time to have accepted.
But for years after this, Andrew was the only master and
minister in his house devoted to God; but he steadily
maintained divine worship upon the Sabbath, and not
without success, for he had the happiness of seeing some
of his neighbours, one at a time, come and unite with him
in serving God.</p>

<p>After several years, Elder Lehman, from Ephrata, made
them a visit, and proposed to raise an establishment similar
to that at the former place. To this Andrew cheerfully
acceded, and accordingly, as soon as circumstances would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">{245}</a></span>
permit, the estate and buildings were formally conveyed to
the Society. It was not a gift, however. Andrew had a
large family dependent upon him for support. The land
had been brought into a state of cultivation by their mutual
efforts, and strict justice required that the interests of all
should be considered in its alienation. Everything was
fairly appraised, and time given to the Society to pay the
appraisement to him and his heirs. This arrangement was
followed by the happiest consequences. Andrew and his
family were amply provided for, and he lived to see his
children and his children's children become members of the
Society which had arisen through his means. He and his
companion in life went down to the grave in a good old
age, and are now doubtless raising their voices with that
company who were redeemed from the earth.</p>

<p>The estate consists, at present, of 165 acres of land, in
a high state of cultivation, and is very productive. It is a
stiff loam, upon a limestone bottom, and is, therefore, well
adapted to grass and the cereal grains. They are abundantly
supplied with farm buildings. The principal barn,
situated on a hillside, built of stone and brick, is 50 feet
wide and 102 feet long, with a roomy overshoot on the
lower side; the lower, or under-ground story, contains
several stables for the accommodation of the domestic
animals; the yard is well supplied with pure water, and
everything bears the marks of thrift, industry, and economy.
There are two flourishing orchards, well supplied
with a choice variety of fruit, and two neatly cultivated
gardens. Much of the wearing apparel is manufactured
by the sisters, and the visiter who passes the building
appropriated to that industrious use, will be strongly reminded
of a classical quotation from the Odyssey, where
Calypso is represented as</p>

<div class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">{246}</a></div>

<div class="center small">"With voice celestial, chanting to the loom,"</div>

<p class="nodent">and her damsels,</p>

<div class="stanza">

<div class="verse indent26">"Who cull,</div>
<div class="verse">With hands of rosy white, the purple wool."</div>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The sisters lighten and enliven their industrious pursuits
with music; and many a strain that would draw tears of rapture
from listening multitudes, is blended, and even made
more pastoral and effective by the sound of the shuttle,
and the noise of the spinning wheel. There are likewise a
blacksmith's shop, and a cooper and cabinet-maker's shop,
where the brothers pursue their mechanical occupations.
There is also a flouring mill, where, beside custom work,
two thousand barrels of flour are annually produced.
This is situated on a perennial stream that flows through,
and abundantly waters the estate. It is an arm of
the Antetum River, a tributary of the Potomac. The
dwelling-house is most pleasantly situated about six
paces from the stream on its south bank. This dwelling
is a convent or religious house, and is styled "The
Nunnery," by the country people. It presents a singular
and unique appearance, being about one hundred and fifty
feet long, by thirty feet wide, and three stories high; the
lower story is built of blue limestone, and the others of
brick. The lower story is even with the ground on the
south side, before which, and between the two orchards,
there is a small grassy lawn. There are three front entrances,
of which the middle entrance communicates with
the dining hall, where a company of sixty or seventy
guests might be conveniently accommodated. On the
north side, projecting from the middle of the main building,
with an entrance into the dining hall, are the rooms
appropriated to domestic and culinary purposes. Over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">{247}</a></span>
the dining hall, in the second story, is the family chapel,
where worship is regularly performed both in the morning
and at evening. Above this, in a small cupola, is
the convent bell, whence a rope passes through each
floor into the centre of the dining hall. The west end
of the building, from the dining hall round, contains exclusively
the apartments of the brethren connected with
the establishment; the east end of the building, beginning
with the same division, contains exclusively the apartments
of the sisters. In each department there are spare
rooms for company, with sleeping rooms on the north side
in both stories. In the centre of the cellar there is a
beautiful fountain of clear spring water, incessantly flowing
in an abundant stream. This is distributed in every
convenient manner to the different parts of the establishment.
Along the north side of the building, there stretches
a luxuriant meadow, about one hundred paces across, which
is abundantly watered by two streams; one, the creek before
mentioned, the other, a brooklet of smaller dimensions.
These are crossed by two wooden bridges, and a well-worn
path leads to the meeting-house, situated on the north side
of the meadow, adjoining the public road, which runs
through the estate. The meeting-house, which is sixty by
fifty feet, is built of stone, without a gallery. The adjoining
building of smaller dimensions communicates with it
on the west end, which exactly resembles an English
vestry, although it is in reality a kitchen. About twenty-five
paces from the convent, near the eastern border of the
meadow, is the waste-gate for the mill. Here there is a
bend in the creek, and at this point is formed their baptistery,
well supplied at all seasons with pure water. Three
steps lead down into this beautiful fount. In this place
we were forcibly reminded of that exquisitely beautiful
hymn,</p>

<p>This Society keeps no journal, has no written history,
nor humanly composed creed. However, they have a
charter, obtained from the state legislature, in which they
are known as Seventh-day Baptists. By this charter they
are authorized to hold and govern the estate and the house,
by by-laws of their own formation and adoption, which are
represented and defended by five trustees elected by a
plurality of the votes of all the male members of the
Society. In these by-laws it is made a condition of admission,
that the inmates of the house shall be single persons;
however, they are not disqualified by a state of widowhood.
They must also be conscientious observers of the seventh
day, and must have shared in the ordinances of baptism,
and possess reputed piety. Their application for admission
must be made to the trustees, who are the authorized
judges of their eligibility. No vow, no promise of unconditional
and continued celibacy is ever required, but if they
subsequently wish to marry, which is sometimes the case,
no unkind treatment ensues; on the contrary, they leave
the house like a sister going from the family of her kindred,
when every one is attentive to her future wants. No person
entering the Society can retain independent estate or personal
property; but should they bring property with them,
it is subjected to a fair appraisement, and a certificate of the
same given; and should the person subsequently leave, the
same or its value is restored without interest. If the inmate
dies in the convent, or a recognised inmate of the
same, all the property accrues permanently to the establishment.
No one receives wages, but all participate in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">{249}</a></span>
the comforts of the house; and the charter secures the
whole of the estate and its incomes to the single brethren
and sisters as their property. The labours of the establishment
are shared alike by all; the brethren under the
direction of the prior, and the sisters under the direction
of the prioress. In no respect, however, is there any pre-eminence
of authority or class; their offices are designed
to subserve good order—nothing more. They are in truth
a band where fraternal regard and equality of right regulate
all their conduct.</p>

<p>In 1847, there were nine brothers and fourteen sisters
who were inmates of the convent. The other members of
the Society have no personal rights in the property of the
estate; and there is no more community of interests among
them than there is among other denominations of Christians.
In church discipline and government they are decidedly
congregational. Their officers are elected by a majority
of the votes of the members. They are averse to paying
their pastors a stated salary; but believe that he should
be assisted voluntarily according to his necessities. The
convent and all the buildings are exceedingly neat and
well-kept; the furniture being plain and convenient without
any superfluities or finery. The venerable pastor,
Andrew Fahnestock, having lost his wife, made a distribution
of his property among his children, and took up his
residence in the convent some time since. All visiters are
likewise requested to make the convent their home, particularly
during the public meetings, and are furnished in it
with private apartments. Their yearly meetings are attended
by many who reside in distant parts, these, as they
arrive, are most hospitably welcomed; the brothers saluting
the visiting brothers with a holy kiss; the sisters
saluting the visiting sisters in the same manner, but the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">{250}</a></span>
brothers and sisters only shaking hands. When the meeting
is over, and these visiters are preparing to depart, the
same affectionate observance is again tendered to all. At
these meetings a supper is spread in the meeting-house,
which is the anciently celebrated Agapa, or love-feast, held
in imitation of the Last Supper, of which the Redeemer
partook with his disciples, before he was led out like a
lamb to the slaughter, and in connexion with the institution
of the Eucharist. At this supper everything is previously
prepared, and there is no cooking done except to
make coffee. Here appears the use of the vestry kitchen,
adjoining the meeting-house, with its cellar and well-stored
larder. In this apartment are vessels over fixed furnaces
prepared for heating water, coffee, and the like. The
meeting-house has two front entrances, and is seated with
the males on one side, and the females on the other. It
is furnished with settees and long narrow tables, which
serve for their books during worship, and for meals during
the love-feasts. About midway of the house, on the back
end, is one about eight feet, appropriated to the ministry,
there being no other pulpit in the house. The tables at
the love-feasts are furnished with a good supply, and a
sufficient variety of all the necessary aliments of life, without
any superfluities; and all are invited to partake. This
being over, and the things cleared away, the communion
table is furnished for the Lord's Supper. The holy rites
are begun by singing and prayer; the thirteenth chapter
of John is then read, and the officiating ministers discourse
upon it, when these servants of the church lay aside their
coats, go to the kitchen vestry, gird themselves with long
towels, and each one taking a small wooden tub half filled
with tepid water, return to the brethren's side of the house,
and commence the ceremony of washing each other's feet,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">{251}</a></span>
repeating meanwhile the words of your Saviour: "Therefore
if I, your Lord and master, have washed your feet, so
ye ought also to wash one another's feet." The same is
performed on the female side of the house by two aged
sisters. This being ended, all again sit down, and every
one appears absorbed in silent prayer and meditation for a
few minutes. The officiating ministers then take the bread
of the communion, and one of them, after giving thanks,
and imploring the divine favour, carries the plate before
the others, so as to stand before two of the communicants.
He then breaks one of the pieces of the bread into two
parts, giving half to one and the other half to the other,
saying, "Take, eat; this is my body, which is broken for
you; this do in remembrance of me." This formulary is
repeated at each time of breaking the bread, until all the
communicants have received a portion. In distributing the
wine, the ministers, instead of the deacons, carry the goblets.
The whole concludes with singing. They are all masters
in music, and, what appears to me extremely appropriate,
their hymns in German were all composed by members of
their own order, and have never been given to the world.
Many of them exhibit considerable poetic talent. The
same is true of their music, which is perfectly unique; but
so soft, solemn, soul-stirring, and melodious, that the listener
half forgets its reality, and holds his breath for fear of
breaking the enchantment. They have three volumes, of
which a small edition has been printed for their own use,
and there is not a light or jigging beat in the whole collection.
They frequently make additions in manuscript, and
take great pleasure in making new books with the pen, of
which many have very richly ornamented pages. While
listening to their melting melodious strains, one cannot
fail to revert in imagination to that new song which was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">{252}</a></span>
sung before the Lamb, and before the beasts, and the
elders, and which no man could learn but those who were
redeemed from the earth. Their style of singing, though
altogether different from that of modern congregations, is
extremely effective, and such, as I believe, few persons of
taste and sensibility could listen to, without shedding tears
of silent rapture. They have no choir, but all, both young
and old, sing, being directed in this exercise by a leader.</p>

<p>There is perhaps no ordinance of the Christian church
more highly interesting to a casual observer, and more
fraught with hallowed associations to a devout mind, than
the rite of baptism, when it is administered in the manner
corresponding with the Word of God. This is particularly
the case at Snowhill, where everything is in such
perfect keeping and character. The candidates for baptism
being previously examined and accepted as suitable
subjects for that holy ordinance by the pastors, an announcement
to that effect is made to the congregation.
They are then suitably attired, and all repair, forming a
procession, to the baptistery, where a thronging multitude
is generally assembled. Here the scene is extremely solemn
and affecting, and all nature appears to sympathize in the
deep solemnity. Even the sunlight, as it bathes the verdant
hillside, the smooth meadow, and the golden orchards
in a flood of glory, seems to partake a softer radiance. A
hundred snowy clouds appear here and there on the blue
heaven above, and it requires no great stretch of the imagination
to fancy that behind or upon them the waving wings
of seraphs have been furled, and that forms of ineffable
beauty are bending there, and watching with interest the
dedication of souls to God. A flood of hallowed associations
comes rushing into the mind. We think of Jordan,
of the multitudes who gathered upon its banks, and who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">{253}</a></span>
were baptized "confessing their sins." The venerable
appearance of the Baptist, that first preacher of the kingdom
of God. And then the Great High Priest of our Salvation,
who came hither to set an example for his servants
in all coming time. But this pleasing revery is broken by
the voice of the pastor. A hymn is given out; and then
from the midst of the company arises a deep, full, melodious
swell of harmony. It is unlike singing; it seems
the very soul of heavenly music breathing out an ecstasy of
thanksgiving. The music ceases; a low soft echo breathes
through the air, so lately living with sweet sounds, and
over the waters; again all is silent. The pastor now
stretches out his hands, and lifts his eyes to heaven: "Let
us pray." Some kneel, others remain standing, but all
assume the look and action of devout humility. The prayer
ended, the pastor descends into the pool; the candidate,
assisted by a brother or sister, descends after him. Reaching
the lower step, he takes her, if a sister, by the left arm,
and leads her down to a suitable depth, where she kneels
in the water. She applies water to her face, and he does
the same to the back of her head, waiting a moment for
her to recover her thoughts and acquire a frame of mind
suitable for the occasion. Then, laying his left hand upon
the forepart of her head, and his right hand upon the back
between the shoulders, he says, "I baptize thee in the
name of the Father," and immerses the candidate, face
foremost; then, raising her up to her former position, he
gives time for a like recovery of self-possession, and adds,
"and the Son," and immerses her in the same manner a
second time; then, giving a like time for recovery, he continues,
"and the Holy Ghost," and proceeds as before.
Then while she is yet kneeling in the water, he lays both
hands upon her head, and offers a short invocation for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">{254}</a></span>
Spirit of God to seal this obedient handmaid as a child of
God. During all this time, the multitude exhibits a deep
interest, and maintains a perfect silence; the candidate
manifests the greatest composure, and all appear to feel
that the Saviour is near.</p>

<p>The German Seventh-day Baptists profess to have no
other guide than the inspired Word of God; and to this
they profess to exactly conform, omitting nothing enjoined,
and adding nothing to the Observances there given. Their
simplicity is truly remarkable, and I believe, truly pure.
They are non-resistant in sentiment, but they plainly
preach the righteousness of the kingdom of God. They
are likewise remarkably amiable in their intercourse with
each other. There is a similar society in Bedford County,
under the pastoral care of Elder King, but I have been
unable to make myself acquainted with any incidents connected
with its history.</p>

<p>There is one subject connected with the history of this
people, which, from deference to my country and its institutions,
I would willingly pass over in silence; justice,
however, compels me to do otherwise. These societies,
harmless and inoffensive as the members are, have, for a
number of years past, been very much annoyed and disturbed
at their annual meetings by a number of wicked
and licentious persons. Being entirely averse to litigation
of any kind, they patiently bore with all. This only
seemed to encourage increased disturbance, until the 17th
of May, 1845, when it became so outrageous at their annual
meeting, that an individual who was not a member, instituted
a prosecution against several persons for a riot.
This resulted in the condemnation and punishment of
sixteen individuals, whose friends, from malicious and
revengeful motives, immediately commenced suits against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">{255}</a></span>
these Seventh-day Christians for labouring on the first
day.</p>

<p>To this they plead guilty, and cheerfully paid their fines
and the costs; but in consequence of the great inconveniences
to which they were subjected, they petitioned the
legislature for relief, though without effect.<span class="fnanchor"><a

It may be interesting to posterity to know that in the United States
of America, and about the middle of the nineteenth century, Plymon
Seaver, of Vermont, was confined in jail for a long time, for attending
to secular concerns upon the first day of the week. About the same
time, or August 26, 1845, Obed Snowberger was fined four dollars, for
being engaged in worldly employment upon the first day of the week.
Mr. Snowberger was a worthy member of the German Seventh-day
Baptist fraternity in Pennsylvania, and the prosecution was carried on
in Quincy Township, Franklin County, and before Samuel Sibbet, as
justice of the peace. Subsequently nine others of the same people
were subjected to prosecution and fines for the same reasons.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
